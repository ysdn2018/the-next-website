The festival wants to elicit feelings of unease with their marketing material, and make the viewerâ€™s pulse quicken.</p>\n<p>By layering sounds and patterns, there is a growing sense of unease and trepidation that results in a climax that abruptly breaks off into the festival branding. Black and white were used to symbolize the high contrast often found in the thriller/horror genre (playing off fear of the dark), with splashes of red to represent the often gory themes.</p>\n<p>By using four checkerboard patterns stacked one on top of the other, I was able to create a variety of textures by transforming the layers separately. The typeface, Lemon Milk, was used because of its striking angles, playing off of the pulse beat.</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class="gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper"\n            style="padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem"\n          >\n            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mKhtNyyPSkY?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen style="\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          "></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>',frontmatter:{title:"Pulse Film Festival",graduate:"Steph Hoekstra",category:"Motion Design",category2:"Typography",category3:null,image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.5,src:"/static/hoekstra_steph_pulseff-9701090ecedddf71aa53ae468896692b-a7a62.jpg",srcSet:"/static/hoekstra_steph_pulseff-9701090ecedddf71aa53ae468896692b-5a1a9.jpg 375w,\n/static/hoekstra_steph_pulseff-9701090ecedddf71aa53ae468896692b-0908c.jpg 750w,\n/static/hoekstra_steph_pulseff-9701090ecedddf71aa53ae468896692b-a7a62.jpg 1500w,\n/static/hoekstra_steph_pulseff-9701090ecedddf71aa53ae468896692b-83d7d.jpg 2000w",sizes:"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"}}}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/work/pulse-film-festival/",name:"/Pulse Film Festival/"}}}});
