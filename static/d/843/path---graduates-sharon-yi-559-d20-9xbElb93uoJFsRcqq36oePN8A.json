{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Sharon Yi","noun":"Perspective","verb":"Observing","intro":"A friend once told Sharon, “art is not necessarily about creativity, but about observation”. This quote is one that really relates to her and her take on art. Sharon believes that art is not always about how much ‘creativity’ is put into it – of course it could to others as art has no limitations – but is about the artist showing what he/she sees. Most people focus on the ‘creative’ aspect of art but Sharon believes that if one focuses on creating art that represents their passions and views, then that should be enough to fuel their ‘creative juices’. The creative process shouldn't be forced, it should be natural and the most original thing that could come from art; something that comes from one’s passions and own perspective. \nSharon’s goal as a designer is to show people her feelings/perspectives through her work, and to affect their lives in a positive way.","hobbies":"Binge-watching Netflix shows","music":"","tools":null,"watch":"Sense 8, Scandal, Black Mirror, This Is Us","typeface":null,"twitter":null,"instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/sharon.yi/","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-yi-66215110a/","email":"sharon.yi@me.com","website":null,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAbABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBAgQF/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAZU/ONLicpDlG8sWf//EABoQAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAMREiH/2gAIAQEAAQUC5yKwY5LW5rZsMufpzKm1LhK/XIAb/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASD/2gAIAQMBAT8BCP/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEg/9oACAECAQE/AVj/xAAaEAACAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIQcREx/9oACAEBAAY/AjxrvlNkNrLiR0fEf//EABoQAQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQWH/2gAIAQEAAT8hoLYIKnR9jJdD5CTWPXIsRS8xEvW5U26ZALBqNwAnRENAC5//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEPcyMf/EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESEQ/9oACAEDAQE/EKJvk2Dxw//EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABETFB/9oACAECAQE/EIOEL0WH/8QAHBABAAMBAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBoVFx/9oACAEBAAE/ELnEC1fJQWChKr2DfI6Dx/W8mNvgYK59+QLl7NVC8v2aiI/W4oN11EgC0B3YIYAR9Lg7ksCf/9k=","width":60,"height":75,"src":"/static/a76b003e3e58208052e9c12d07d8398d/7d7e5/Sharon_Yi-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a76b003e3e58208052e9c12d07d8398d/7d7e5/Sharon_Yi-1.jpg 1x,\n/static/a76b003e3e58208052e9c12d07d8398d/ab647/Sharon_Yi-1.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/a76b003e3e58208052e9c12d07d8398d/253d6/Sharon_Yi-1.jpg 2x,\n/static/a76b003e3e58208052e9c12d07d8398d/55772/Sharon_Yi-1.jpg 3x"}}}}},"projects":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"e12aa9b5-36f6-53cd-9115-e59c02d75676","fields":{"slug":"/work/pillow-thoughts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pillow Thoughts","category":"Editorial Design","image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2,"src":"/static/21fe839fbc8359ac2c1b24d1ef892fd2/34b76/editorial1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/21fe839fbc8359ac2c1b24d1ef892fd2/0804d/editorial1.jpg 250w,\n/static/21fe839fbc8359ac2c1b24d1ef892fd2/76abd/editorial1.jpg 500w,\n/static/21fe839fbc8359ac2c1b24d1ef892fd2/34b76/editorial1.jpg 1000w,\n/static/21fe839fbc8359ac2c1b24d1ef892fd2/7c917/editorial1.jpg 1500w,\n/static/21fe839fbc8359ac2c1b24d1ef892fd2/3e8a3/editorial1.jpg 2000w,\n/static/21fe839fbc8359ac2c1b24d1ef892fd2/d3095/editorial1.jpg 3000w,\n/static/21fe839fbc8359ac2c1b24d1ef892fd2/05b0e/editorial1.jpg 3201w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/graduates/sharon-yi/","name":"/Sharon Yi/","title":"Sharon Yi","graduateName":null,"graduate":"/null/","category":"/null/","category2":"/null/"}}
