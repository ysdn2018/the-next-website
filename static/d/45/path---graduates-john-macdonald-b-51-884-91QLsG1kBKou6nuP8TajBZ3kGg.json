{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"","frontmatter":{"title":"John MacDonald","noun":"Project","verb":"Understanding","intro":"John began exploring art and design in high school but never pursued it seriously until a few years ago. After Returning to Sheridan College as a mature student, an instructor suggested applying to the Bachelor of Design program at York. Now nearing the end of his journey at YSDN he is excited to take on the next challenge. As a designer, John approaches every design problem as a learning opportunity. His design balances functionality with creating a memorable experience for the audience. Johnâ€™s strengths are in storytelling, combining typography and illustrations.","hobbies":null,"music":"too many to list but right now Biffy Clyro, the Dead Weather and Radiohead","tools":"Pens and sketch book, Illustrator, InDesign and After Effects","watch":"Vikings, Peaky Blinders, Portlandia, the IT Crowd and the Office  ","typeface":"Fira Sans","twitter":null,"instagram":null,"linkedin":"www.linkedin.com/in/john-macdonald","email":"macdonald.john09@gmail.com","website":"johnamac.com","headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":60,"height":75,"src":"/static/d5c822a11e09ab914b05f0a60c705912/7d7e5/John_McDonald-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d5c822a11e09ab914b05f0a60c705912/7d7e5/John_McDonald-1.jpg 1x,\n/static/d5c822a11e09ab914b05f0a60c705912/ab647/John_McDonald-1.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/d5c822a11e09ab914b05f0a60c705912/253d6/John_McDonald-1.jpg 2x,\n/static/d5c822a11e09ab914b05f0a60c705912/55772/John_McDonald-1.jpg 3x"}}}}},"projects":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"9ce5988d-8ec5-5eab-967c-4c1dfd25f4e1","fields":{"slug":"/work/offside-magazine/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Offside Magazine","category":"Editorial Design","image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2,"src":"/static/64bbb088070489126bfafe0db7b4de0c/34b76/offside_grad.jpg","srcSet":"/static/64bbb088070489126bfafe0db7b4de0c/0804d/offside_grad.jpg 250w,\n/static/64bbb088070489126bfafe0db7b4de0c/76abd/offside_grad.jpg 500w,\n/static/64bbb088070489126bfafe0db7b4de0c/34b76/offside_grad.jpg 1000w,\n/static/64bbb088070489126bfafe0db7b4de0c/0dcaa/offside_grad.jpg 1224w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/graduates/john-macdonald/","name":"/John MacDonald/","title":"John MacDonald","graduateName":null,"graduate":"/null/","category":"/null/","category2":"/null/"}}
