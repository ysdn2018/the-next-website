{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Meaghan Gray","noun":"Possibility","verb":"Exploring","intro":"Meaghan focuses on design thinking and generating design that is accommodating to the people it serves. Rather than being focused on profitability, Meaghan believes in pushing boundaries of thought and developing innovative ideas. Research is important to her, and it makes up a major portion of the work she does. She brainstorms, asks questions, and prototypes every angle to achieve the best solution. Meaghan is not afraid to take risks. Understanding the demographic she is designing for, and their needs and concerns is one of her major goals in the designs she creates. Meaghan is not afraid to take the path less travelled and refuses to conform to expected standards of practice in design. She is both rational and conceptual. Meaghan cares more about what works than what sells. What she creates is not nearly as important as the people it is created for. Meaghan embraces technological development and creates innovative design in tandem with these advancements. Her design is honest and does not manipulate the consumer with promises it cannot keep. She endeavours to keep her work environmentally friendly and actively contributes to the preservation of the environment. Meaghan conserves resources and works in a way that creates minimal stress on the environment. She believes that good design is as little design as possible. Meaghanâ€™s focus is to provide simplicity whenever possible. She operates both in print and digital and has a deep understanding of production. Meaghan is constantly growing and learning with design and keeps an open mind to new ideas and opportunities. She always strives to be innovative and cutting edge to create works that are timeless.","hobbies":null,"music":null,"tools":null,"watch":null,"typeface":null,"twitter":null,"instagram":null,"linkedin":null,"email":"meaghansydneygray@gmail.com","website":"meaghangray.com","headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":60,"height":75,"src":"/the-next-website/static/29ca3b5ab89adec10bba0a10e66d0875/7d7e5/Meaghan_Gray-1.jpg","srcSet":"/the-next-website/static/29ca3b5ab89adec10bba0a10e66d0875/7d7e5/Meaghan_Gray-1.jpg 1x,\n/the-next-website/static/29ca3b5ab89adec10bba0a10e66d0875/ab647/Meaghan_Gray-1.jpg 1.5x,\n/the-next-website/static/29ca3b5ab89adec10bba0a10e66d0875/253d6/Meaghan_Gray-1.jpg 2x,\n/the-next-website/static/29ca3b5ab89adec10bba0a10e66d0875/55772/Meaghan_Gray-1.jpg 3x"}}}}},"projects":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"216b2e8e-3f74-5780-a803-e3da83e6ac21","fields":{"slug":"/work/disassembling-the-novel/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Disassembling the Novel","category":"Book Design","image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEBf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAddqUrGH/8QAGRAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMAARBC/9oACAEBAAEFAt5URNqf/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPwE//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPwE//8QAGBAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBESIHH/2gAIAQEABj8CpJrB/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERURAxQXH/2gAIAQEAAT8ho6QPbwn5FpMf/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABCTD//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8QP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8QP//EAB0QAQABAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAETGRECFBUbH/2gAIAQEAAT8QVKyy0YKoZRL3pOJvk/muVfNP/9k=","aspectRatio":2,"src":"/the-next-website/static/0542f1dacc6dcdba7b89902cd54e2728/34b76/rtb_cover.jpg","srcSet":"/the-next-website/static/0542f1dacc6dcdba7b89902cd54e2728/0804d/rtb_cover.jpg 250w,\n/the-next-website/static/0542f1dacc6dcdba7b89902cd54e2728/76abd/rtb_cover.jpg 500w,\n/the-next-website/static/0542f1dacc6dcdba7b89902cd54e2728/34b76/rtb_cover.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"66d221ec-e52e-5b5a-abe5-b4ddd056d77a","fields":{"slug":"/work/pwr-smrt/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PWR SMRT","category":"UI/UX","image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2,"src":"/the-next-website/static/cadb3569b9835f3a5d440d67384a7a01/34b76/pwrsmrt_main.jpg","srcSet":"/the-next-website/static/cadb3569b9835f3a5d440d67384a7a01/0804d/pwrsmrt_main.jpg 250w,\n/the-next-website/static/cadb3569b9835f3a5d440d67384a7a01/76abd/pwrsmrt_main.jpg 500w,\n/the-next-website/static/cadb3569b9835f3a5d440d67384a7a01/34b76/pwrsmrt_main.jpg 1000w,\n/the-next-website/static/cadb3569b9835f3a5d440d67384a7a01/7c917/pwrsmrt_main.jpg 1500w,\n/the-next-website/static/cadb3569b9835f3a5d440d67384a7a01/3e8a3/pwrsmrt_main.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/graduates/meaghan-gray/","name":"/Meaghan Gray/","title":"Meaghan Gray","graduateName":null,"graduate":"/null/","category":"/null/","category2":"/null/"}}
