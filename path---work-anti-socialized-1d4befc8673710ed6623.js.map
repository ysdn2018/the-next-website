The Government of Ontario estimates that 1 in 3 Canadian women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime, and 99% of the time, the perpetrator is male.

Initially, I was going to approach this project by telling my own story, but I eventually realized that if my goal was to reach both men and women, I could do so more effectively by utilizing and applying what I’ve learned through my experiences to tell a common, accessible, and nuanced story, that doesn’t need to center around my specific encounters.</p>\\n<p>There are 5 sections to the film. Each section builds on the metaphors and narrative provided in the previous sections, and bright, colourful, playful imagery helps to balance out the somewhat controversial, taboo, and polarizing subject matter.

Most of the conversations happening around these issues are fuelled by anger and defensiveness. Although these are valid emotions and are important for individuals to express, they are not tools that lead to understanding, change, or compassion. Anti(socialized) looks at social norms that result in problematic behaviour, and instead of blaming the individual, it looks at root causes that we are all subjected to by society. Utilizing a non-confrontational approach, this film gently urges viewers to look at their own socialization in a new, more compassionate way that hopefully results in behavioural change.</p>\\n<div>\\n          <div\\n            class=\\\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\\\"\\n            style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\\\"\\n          >\\n            <iframe src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gDniM-vaDWc?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"autoplay; encrypted-media\\\" allowfullscreen style=\\\"\\n            position: absolute;\\n            top: 0;\\n            left: 0;\\n            width: 100%;\\n            height: 100%;\\n          \\\"></iframe>\\n          </div>\\n          </div>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"(Anti)socialized\",\"graduate\":\"Danielle Sheahan\",\"category\":\"Time Based Communication\",\"category2\":\"Motion Design\",\"category3\":\"Communication Design\",\"image\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAJABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECBP/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAED/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHssUlsJ//EABgQAQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIAAQMx/9oACAEBAAEFAja1lGMOX//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABYQAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgIf/aAAgBAQAGPwIq/wD/xAAZEAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABAxEXH/2gAIAQEAAT8h1EqeIpWpv7X/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEJQf/8QAFhEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAx/9oACAEDAQE/EBF//8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAh/9oACAECAQE/EE0n/8QAGRAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAEEGh/9oACAEBAAE/EDU5ihExlvXr/9k=\",\"aspectRatio\":1.5,\"src\":\"/static/antisocialized-main-image-7f1e9ac96906066ea0a2df190d0b1546-a7a62.jpg\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/antisocialized-main-image-7f1e9ac96906066ea0a2df190d0b1546-5a1a9.jpg 375w,\\n/static/antisocialized-main-image-7f1e9ac96906066ea0a2df190d0b1546-0908c.jpg 750w,\\n/static/antisocialized-main-image-7f1e9ac96906066ea0a2df190d0b1546-a7a62.jpg 1500w,\\n/static/antisocialized-main-image-7f1e9ac96906066ea0a2df190d0b1546-83d7d.jpg 2000w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"}}}}},\"projectsInCategory\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"(Anti)socialized\",\"graduate\":\"Danielle Sheahan\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Book Trailer for Sputnik Sweetheart - A Novel by Haruki Murakami\",\"graduate\":\"David Benoit\"}}}]},\"projectByStudent\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"(Anti)socialized\",\"graduate\":\"Danielle Sheahan\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/work/anti-socialized/\",\"name\":\"/(Anti)socialized/\",\"title\":\"(Anti)socialized\",\"graduate\":\"/Danielle Sheahan/\",\"category\":\"/Time Based Communication/\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---work-anti-socialized-1d4befc8673710ed6623.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"headings\":[{\"value\":\"Project Overview\",\"depth\":2},{\"value\":\"Target Audience\",\"depth\":2},{\"value\":\"Storytelling Strategy\",\"depth\":2},{\"value\":\"Why (Anti)socialized Matters\",\"depth\":2}],\"html\":\"<h2>Project Overview</h2>\\n<p>(Anti)socialized is a short film that uses visual metaphor and storytelling to explore how gendered socialization impacts our sexual interactions.
