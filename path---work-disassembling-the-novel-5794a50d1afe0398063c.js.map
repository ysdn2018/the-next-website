This novel has been around since 1954 and tells the disastrous story of a group of boys shipwrecked on a deserted island as war wages on outside. While it has all the elements of a great novel, it is the perfect example of how a wonderful read can be neglected due to how the novel is presented. The story is reimagined as an interactive text through tactile touch. The novel has been deconstructed from its original form and reassembled in an exciting new manner which meets the needs of a generation that demands stimulation, excitement, and grabs both the attention and imagination. Paper textures, die cuts, and embossing are all utilized to reimagine some of the major themes and ideas within the novel using tactility. Using texture as a way to communicate pushes how materials and the way in which they are used, can convey a message. While in the reader’s hands the novel comes alive, through the textures, the sights and feelings it provokes, and the physical pleasure of the book itself. In this way it is a reinvention of the physical book and hints at the direction books can take. </p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 67.10000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"\\\"His mind was crowded with memories\\\" page from Disassembling the Novel\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-755ae.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-f07fc.jpg 125w,\\n/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-9d06f.jpg 250w,\\n/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-755ae.jpg 500w,\\n/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-63ca3.jpg 750w,\\n/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-9b9a3.jpg 1000w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h2>Final</h2>\\n<p>This reimagined <em>Lord of the Flies</em> is an example of what the future of the book may be.

Using texture as a way to communicate pushes how materials and the way in which they are used, can convey a message. While in the reader’s hands the novel comes alive, through the textures, the sights and feelings it provokes, and the physical pleasure of the book itself. In this way it is a reinvention of the physical book and hints at the direction books can take. </p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 67.10000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"\\\"His mind was crowded with memories\\\" page from Disassembling the Novel\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-755ae.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-f07fc.jpg 125w,\\n/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-9d06f.jpg 250w,\\n/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-755ae.jpg 500w,\\n/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-63ca3.jpg 750w,\\n/static/rtb_circles-a827525789da6e2fd4caca6a3d5b14b4-9b9a3.jpg 1000w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h2>Final</h2>\\n<p>This reimagined <em>Lord of the Flies</em> is an example of what the future of the book may be.
