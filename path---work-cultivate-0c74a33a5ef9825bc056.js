Local chefs, restaurateurs, farmers, brew masters and food artisans come together for two days, once a year to celebrate food, drink, art and culture. Over the course of the development of this identity for Cultivate, I wanted to create an identity that was easily translated across all platforms. After many iterations I chose the symbolic approach because the icon is strong and can be really easily integrated throughout many mediums. I was inspired by Brian Steely’s line drawings when I was creating the identity, which is an illustration style I hadn’t experimented with before. I decided to use it because it reminded me of some craft beer label illustrations I had seen, and since this festival deals with food and drink, I felt it represented both of those well. The colours I chose were also really important to the brand as this festival marks the start of fall, and the end of the summer harvest.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Cultivate ",graduate:"Victoria Cake",category:"Communication Design",category2:"Brand Identity",category3:null,image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.5,src:"/the-next-website/static/cultivate_postermock-dbb40c3ee2dc49c86507a21661319fd4-a7a62.jpg",srcSet:"/the-next-website/static/cultivate_postermock-dbb40c3ee2dc49c86507a21661319fd4-5a1a9.jpg 375w,\n/the-next-website/static/cultivate_postermock-dbb40c3ee2dc49c86507a21661319fd4-0908c.jpg 750w,\n/the-next-website/static/cultivate_postermock-dbb40c3ee2dc49c86507a21661319fd4-a7a62.jpg 1500w,\n/the-next-website/static/cultivate_postermock-dbb40c3ee2dc49c86507a21661319fd4-25aa2.jpg 1845w",sizes:"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"}}}}},projectsInCategory:{edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Art Basel Promotion Campaign",graduate:"ROMAN DROBOT"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Beakerhead Festival",graduate:"Jessica Brennan"}}}]},projectByStudent:{edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Cultivate ",graduate:"Victoria Cake"}}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"/work/cultivate/",name:"/Cultivate /",title:"Cultivate ",graduate:"/Victoria Cake/",category:"/Communication Design/"}}}});
