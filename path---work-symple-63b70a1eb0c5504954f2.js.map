Sexual assault, child abuse, combat, and witnessing death are all common examples of trauma, which can lead to PTSD. Symptoms of PTSD include but are not limited to: nightmares, anxiety, insomnia, and flashbacks.

SYMPLE is designed for any individual who is currently struggling with PTSD, with a specific emphasis on individuals in the age range of 20 - 35 years old. During this age range, people tend to encounter a lot of change in their lives.
