Whole Foods Market is an American company founded in Texas in 1980 that operates in the grocery store industry and the health food store industry. Whole Foods Market products will use Amazon’s infrastructure by offering high quality food at competitive prices at customer’s doorstep. The essential key to build an identity of Whole Foods more interconnected, consistent, meaningful, and accessible branding that can build trust to their customers.

In the beginning, I began to allocate some new essence of words to the brand that would become an important part of rebranding. Healthy, Accessible and Individual. The next step was to select a new tagline that would become an interesting theme “Live Better Everyday” this would be a powerful introduction of the idea of prioritizes your health and focus on creating lifestyle.

While designing a new identity of Whole Foods, I want to represent the natural and welcoming persona. Dark bottle green was the signature choice to represent the company as a whole for what they represent and relate with easily. I wanted to keep the colors natural and organic related which helps to maintain the essence of bright and rich identity similar to their products. Green can help enhance vision, stability and endurance. The dark green color has a healing power to understand their consumers to trust this new identity.
