Life of Sin Gin is a series of special edition gin bottles inspired by true crime. Each of the 3 bottles focuses on a different unsolved crime or undetected serial killer and pulls from elements of each; to embody the essence of the crime, killer and era in which these took place. The design of each of these bottles derives from the nature of investigative work and requires you to search for certain elements, such as the name of the gin, brand or clues from the crime that are incorporated into each design.
