Beakerhead is an annual festival in the heart of Calgary that brings together arts, science and engineering to encourage collaboration, education and ingenuity through art, competition, exhibits, workshops and entertainment. 

Year round programming and community activity culminates into a five-day citywide spectacle consisting of over 60 events centered around delightfully bizarre engineerâ€™s installations and artwork. Through these installations and activities, the festival aims to promote ingenuitive thinking and bring interest to the science and engineering fields. 

The rebrand of this festival aims to celebrate the combination while expressing the fun and uniqueness of each field and the event itself.
