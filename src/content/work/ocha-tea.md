Ocha takes the conventional tea bag and uses it to create a more memorable experience for tea consumers. Based on traditional Origami forms, the simplicity and unique construction of Ochaâ€™s packaging adds visual interest and sets the mood for a more mindful experience: one that is simple, meditative, and relaxing. The goal is to remind consumers to take time to enjoy the little things in life.
