An experimental journey that explores a narrative through a poetic format using 3d visual art forms. By fabricating a 3d space, the visual art forms transcends both emotions and expression. By moving from space to space, users will experience a different emotion in asynchronous order that is all about exploring curiosity and embracing the unknown. Users will be able to navigate through the spaces while having accompanying music and spoken narrative played within each different space. 

(Based on the book Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard)
