About

An experimental journey that explores a narrative through a poetic format using 3d visual art forms. By fabricating a 3d space, the visual art forms transcends both emotions and expression. By, moving from space to space, users will experience a different emotion in asynchronous order that is all about exploring curiosity and embracing the unknown. 

(Based on the book Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard)
