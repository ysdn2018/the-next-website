# Exploring audio visual design through an interactive album

ORA is a multi-dimensional music project by Rosy Glow. The project consists of a 4-song EP with an accommodating web application that allows users to remix different musical components of the album within their browser. The concept behind the project was to blur the lines between the user and the artist and generate an interface where anyone can experience the process of producing music.

## The Album

The album came together throughout the span of my 4th year. The art direction for the album was based around the themes of nostalgia explored within the music while representing the mergence of organic and electronic sonic qualities used in the production. I aimed to balance rigid form with natural photography taken by my father in the 1980s.

The use of the intersecting grid lines symbolize a concept of the 'in between'; intersectional states of being that only last temporarily. This concept was also consciously developed with the intention of designing an interactive interface which could allude to the art direction of the album.

## The Experience

Using the art direction of the album, I worked on designing an interface which could be used as to directly play with and remix elements of the album. I designed a web-based app which allowed users to easily interact with a series of module which over time would allow them to create their own remixes of the album.

The goal with the interface was to balance usability with an abstracted interface. I wanted users with any sort of background to be able to experience the process of making music and be able to actively take part in the music making process within just a few clicks of the mouse.

I developed a series of abstracted modules which recreated the elements often used in electronic music production. I wanted to avoid any sort of allusion to musical elements in order to give the user the chance to learn the interface over time. Using a set of quantized loops alongside a sequencer and expressive lead module, I wanted to give users a playground where no matter what they did, it would sound sonically pleasing.

ORA is currently in the development and mixing/mastering process and is set for a public release in May, 2018.
