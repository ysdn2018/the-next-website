_Dear Craig_, is a perfect bound book that is made up of found poetry from Craigslist. The book is divided into three sections: Missed Connections, Free Stuff, and Rants and Raves, all of which are categories that can be found within Craigslist.

The book mimics and refines the visual language of the website with a minimal approach through the use of colour and a combination of serif and sans serif.  ASCII art accompanies each poem and section opener to express the digital environment Craigslist exists in.
