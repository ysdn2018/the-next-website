## What is Art? What is Design?

A shovel presented by Duchamp is considered art. A chair created by the Eames is considered design. The description of artist and designer have different contextual meanings, however there is undeniable overlap between the two fields. This book tackles the blurred line between art and design, and attempts to distinguish the two fields clearer.

## This is Art. This is Design.

This book is an attempt at distinguishing the overlap between the discipline of art and the discipline of design through writings and images from renounced artists, designers and scholars. The information provided by the book is intended to be educational, and aimed to be created in a way that allowed readers to flow through the readings smoothly. 

Using academic texts and supportive images, the book highlighted some of the important aspects to consider between art and design, for example education systems and transitional time periods. The information is separated into themed sections and the content alternates back and forth between art and design.
