# What is Art? What is Design?

A shovel presented by Duchamp is considered art. A chair created by the Eames is considered design. The description of artist and designer have different contextual meanings, however there is undeniable overlap between the two fields.

_This is Art. This is Design._ tackles the blurred line between art and design through writings and images from renounced artists, designers and scholars. The information provided by the book is intended to be educational, and created in a way that allows readers to flow through the readings smoothly.

Using academic texts and supportive images, the book highlights some of the important aspects to consider between art and design, for example education systems and transitional time periods. The information is separated into coloured, themed sections and the content alternates back and forth between art and design.
