The festival rebrand for the Calgary Stampede opens the doors of the Stampede to a new, young diverse audience while still retaining traditional rodeo supporters. The branding celebrates Canadaâ€™s western culture with a modern twist by using dynamic layouts that suggest energy and excitement. It creates a welcoming western theme for all audiences, whether local or tourists, who have come for the Canadian experience.
