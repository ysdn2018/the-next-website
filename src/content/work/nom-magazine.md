Nom is a food and lifestyle magazine that focuses on pastry and desserts, featuring recipes and suggestion of various cafes and restaurants. The idea of this magazine is meant to inspire people to go in the city, look for food and be relaxed. Including recipes that are easy-to-follow and efficient for busy lives as a student. Also, it introduces food making as a meaningful and fun process rather than just a routine.
