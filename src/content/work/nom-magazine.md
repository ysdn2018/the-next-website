Nom is a food and lifestyle magazine that focuses on pastry and desserts, featuring some easy-to-follow recipes and various suggestions of cafes and restaurants. The idea of this magazine is intended to inspire people to go in the city, look for food and stay relaxed. It also redefines food making as a meaningful and fun process, but not a boring routine.
