Created for the final project for Type in Motion, this clip is an animation of a section from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy audiobook. Using bright colours and motion effects that reflect the quirkiness of the novel, while contrasting and complimenting the eloquent and articulate music and voice.
