Offside Magazine

A magazine which looks at social, political issues which affect soccer. More than just a magazine that looks at player statistics, transfer moves and league tables. Offside looks at positive and negative stories in soccer and provides a platform for discussion. This issue features stories about the corruption in FIFA and the racism problem in Russian soccer.
