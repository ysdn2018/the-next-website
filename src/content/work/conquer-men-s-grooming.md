Conquer Menâ€™s Grooming is a shaving kit designed for young men who take pride in their appearance. The kit packages together the five essential tools necessary to crafting a look that espouses both confidence and class.

The brand name Conquer is a double meaning, serving to reference Alexander the Great, who popularized shaving, as well as to communicate the idea of taking back control of ones appearance. The packaging is entirely sustainable with the inside turning into a stand for your shaving products, while the outer container serves as a garbage can.
