# _Romelia,_ A Typeface for Reading Comprehension

# 

## Introduction

Many students and adults have problems comprehending what they read. Although issues with comprehending what is being read can be caused by the reader’s past experiences and abilities, and not necessarily the typeface alone, creating a typeface that works best at certain font sizes and line lengths while enhancing readability and legibility, can overall shape the comprehension of the reader.

Using research taken from studies on reading comprehension, analyzing some of the most readable and legible typefaces, as well as taking into account personal experiences with lack of information retention, a typeface was developed aiding in reading comprehension when used in large amounts of body copy.



Romelia, a smooth and elegant old style serif typeface is designed to enhance reading comprehension for all ages and eye sight condition. Intended for use at 9-13pt, Romelia is meant for text within print mediums such as books, or longer bodies of text that need to be memorized.

Romelia’s characteristics are inspired by some of the most readible typefaces such as Adobe Garamond, Adobe Caslon, and Baskerville. Their short and bracketed serifs, open counters, large x-height, and long ascenders and descenders, enhance readability and legibility by creating a natural rhythm when leading from one letter to the next, which overall shapes the comprehension of the text being read. 

For best results, Romelia should have a leading of 120-130% of the font size being used and an average line length of 50-60 characters.
