Zoolog is an experience that encourages children to become more active through exploring the world's fauna. The prototype models a journey for young to middle aged children, living in suburban and city areas. The user earns badges by collecting photographic observations of wildlife. Through their journey, prompts and tasks are also suggested to inspire more exploration. "Zoolog" is a wordplay on Zoology, the study of animals.
