Strolling is a psychogeography magazine that aims to stimulate young adults with an intriguing view on societal culture. It combines experimental type, and analog street photography to capture the essence of the city featured in each issue. The first issue features Toronto with a psychogeographic guide of the neighbourhoods within the city written by Shawn Micallef, accompanied by photographs taken by Firas Kauchali.
