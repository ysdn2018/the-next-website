As part of an Editorial course, the objective was to pick a topic of your choosing and find three articles to form the content of the magazine. One of the articles was to be represented strictly using typography, one using typography and illustrations, and the last using typography and photography.  Sprung from personal experiences my topic of choosing was the mental and physical health of post-secondary students. My personal objective was to design a reliable resource providing guidance and support to those looking to lead a healthy lifestyle during their time at school. I know from personal experience that the combination of stress from a full course load, and multiple emotions felt from being away from home and your support system can take a big toll on both your physical and mental health.
