For Millenials, STASH Tea is the brand that will deliver specialty teas using all natural, quality ingredients in packaging which pays tribute to itâ€™s roots. The redesign strategy maintains the natural look and creates a way for easy reproduction by using a bold coloured sticker to distinguish types of tea within their respective categories (ie. herbal, black, and green tea).
