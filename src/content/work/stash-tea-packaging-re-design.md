# For Millenials, STASH Tea is the brand that will deliver specialty teas using all natural, quality ingredients in packaging which pays tribute to it’s roots. 



## The Challenge

STASH Tea’s mission is to become the leader in creating and selling high quality specialty teas and products that enhance the tea drinking experience. However, due to lack of innovation in packaging and branding, STASH Tea is falling behind. Although they have been keeping up with social media such as Instagram and revamping their website to make it more modern, their packaging lacks the appeal and is still stuck to the original package design which doesn’t stand out on shelves. Three different packages – an evolutionary, revolutionary, and transformational design – were to be created to present to a client for a revamp which encompassed the STASH brand and attracted target audience consumers.

## Conclusion

Many millennials have recently begun a need to seek out natural, healthy, and authentic products. By creating a more modern design while keeping the history of STASH within the packaging itself, three versions of the package were created. STASH Tea proclaims that they have high quality teas, however most people who have reviewed the product found it didn’t have much flavour. Because of the bright colours on the boxes of tea, consumer’s expectations of flavour for the company may be higher than others. I lowered these expectations by bringing down the colour to softer tones. This packaging redesign would not only allow for those people who aren’t fond of the product to potentially try it again, but a fresh design would also appeal to those who haven’t tried it before.



The redesign strategy maintains the natural look and creates a way for easy reproduction by using a bold coloured sticker to distinguish types of tea within their respective categories (ie. herbal, black, and green tea).
