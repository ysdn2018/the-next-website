A fun experimentation in package design using transparent materials in order to incorporate the product itself as part of the design. The original inspiration was a jellyfish, with the obvious connection of the word “jelly” in both, and from there a theme of sea creatures was developed.  Illustrations wrap themselves around the package while the colours of the jellybeans create patterns to fill in the line drawings. The colours coordinate to the creature on the front, from blues for the whale to reds and oranges for the crab. 

A simple booklet attached to each package includes a legend of the kinds of jellybeans to be enjoyed from each package.
