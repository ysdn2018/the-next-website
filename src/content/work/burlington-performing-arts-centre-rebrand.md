This project adapts the current Burlington Performing Arts Centre identity by incorporating a bold, yet friendly word-mark logo, along with vibrant applications.

The new visual identity for the Burlington Performing Arts Centre provides a fresh start to better interact with its community and reach beyond its city boarders. Its colourful and bold nature are inviting to everyone, young and old. The rebrand aims to be contemporary, inviting & unified.
