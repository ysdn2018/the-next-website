A brand guideline book for the fictional plant-sitting service Bloomsitter. The objective of this project was to create a visual identity that is friendly, versatile, and professional, allowing for plenty of colourful expression.

## Background

While there are plenty of house sitting and pet sitting services, there are no services that care for the plants in a similar manner, which either leaves the plants in the untrained hands of friend & family or in no hands at all. Bloomsitter is the first ever service that looks after the plants of people who are travelling for extended periods of time, providing the care and nourishment they need to survive.

## Target Audience

The target audience for these services is composed of two groups: young adults who will be away from home, and elderly people who need an extra helping hand in taking care of their plants. Plant care and travelling are quite popular among younger people today while gardening is a well-known hobby among the elderly, making both groups good targets. 

## The Brand

Bloomsitter has three colour schemes to work with, making its image more versatile. The main aspects of the branding include flowery imagery and gradients, which work together to create a fresh and vibrant display, akin to flowers themselves. This approach lends itself well to the goal of making the brand identity both friendly and professional. The three sections of the brand book, About Us, Visuals and Applications, are divided by the colour schemes.
