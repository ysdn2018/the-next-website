Pulse Film Festival is a month-long festival 
that plays thriller/horror genre movies on 
Friday and Saturday nights throughout 
October. The festival wants to elicit feelings of unease
 with their marketing material, and make the
 viewerâ€™s pulse quicken.

By layering sounds and patterns, there is a growing sense of unease and 
trepidation that results in a climax that
 abruptly breaks off into the festival branding.
 Black and white were used to symbolize the 
high contrast often found in the thriller/
horror genre (playing off fear of the dark),
 with splashes of red to represent the often
 gory themes.

By using four checkerboard patterns stacked 
one on top of the other, I was able to create a
 variety of textures by transforming the layers
 separately. The typeface, Lemon Milk, was used 
because of its striking angles, playing off of 
the pulse beat.
