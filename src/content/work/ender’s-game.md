Working within the time-based medium of a book trailer, I devised a motion graphics representation of the award winning science fiction novel Ender's Game which embodied the story and psychological intrigue that only the book could capture.

> Ender's game is a 1985 military science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card. Having previously fought off two alien invasions, Earth is preparing for an impending third invasion by enlisting and training young and brilliant children with the potential to save their planet. The novel follows Ender Wiggin (a boy who shows great promise) as he journies through the trials and psychological challenges of rising through the ranks of the military. With the human race said to be running out of time, Ender's tactical genius is pushed to its limits as he just may be Earth's last hope.
