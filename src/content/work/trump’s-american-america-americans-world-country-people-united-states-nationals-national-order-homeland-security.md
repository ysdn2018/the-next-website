## Summary

This project started with the idea of merging scientific phenomena into design artefacts in order to tell stories in a new way, working through this goal I created a generative type treatment that is inspired by the second law of thermodynamics and used it to express the current state of America. 

## Context

As I mentioned earlier, this research project started off with this question of ‘how can scientific phenomena enter generative design artefacts to tell stories in a different way?” Through this project I wanted to contribute to the dialogue between design, scientific and philosophical practice through my explorative exercises. The research explored how complex concepts can enter everyday design practice, perhaps impacting the way today’s designers approach projects by developing ideas that are rooted in nature as a means of creating more captivating solutions. 

The scientific phenomena that was researched in this project was Entropy. I wasn’t able to research this subject in great detail – entire courses are dedicated to understanding it – instead, I glanced at the scientific concept in order to take what I needed from it to inform the rules of machine-generated works.

> 2. a: the degradation of the matter and energy in the universe to an ultimate state of inert uniformity. Entropy is the general trend of the universe toward death and disorder. – James R. Newman b: a process of degradation or running down or a trend to disorder 3. chaos, disorganization, randomness.

## Process

There were essentially three steps that I took to create this piece. First, it was to research the subject of Entropy to the best of my ability and synthesize it. Then, to convert that synthesis into rules that can be read by a computer. And finally, to execute the rules to form a generative type treatment and use it in a design artefact. 

A pivotal moment in the research phase of this project was I found the text Entropy and Art: An Essay on Disorder and Order by Rudolf Arnheim. It helped me understand entropy within the context of art, and gave me clues for how to proceed in making something that embodies entropy. One of the quotes that jump started the process was "the material world moves from orderly states to an ever-increasing disorder and that the final situation of the universe will be one of maximal disorder” ([Entropy and Art](http://www.aakkozzll.com/pdf/arnheim.pdf), 7).
