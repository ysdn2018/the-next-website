The first place I automatically thought of when we had to choose something important to us to film for this project, was billiards. I love the atmosphere of the pool hall’s I go to, as they are lively, vibrant, and exciting. I am a very outgoing person, and this environment is what I live for. The approach I want to do for this environment is similar in filming styles as Stan Brakhage and Joyce Wieland, with the shaky camera as if you’re there experiencing the space. These filming styles will help me focus more on the game of billiards, the atmosphere in which it is played in, and to tune in closely to the sounds and smells of the pool hall.

The atmosphere in all of the pool hall’s are dark and intimate, yet have a fun vibe with the music and the audio from the many TV’s playing in the background. The pool halls smell like the food that these restaurants make, and the smell of many people in one room. You can hear the noise of people putting chalk on their cues, people breaking the balls with their cue, and the drop of the balls when they go in or miss the pocket. Many sounds and smells can appear in a pool hall.

People are always playing on tables so there is always the sound of the balls breaking, from the time I’ve entered the pool hall to the time I leave. People play pool, music is played, food is cooked, drinks are stirred, and it is an all around good time. Just by listening, you can learn that this space is for laughs, enjoying yourself, and having a night out; no matter if you are good or not at playing pool, it is still fun to attempt playing.
