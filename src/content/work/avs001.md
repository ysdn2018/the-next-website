# Creating generative music through simple interaction.

As the first in the series of Audio Visual Systems, AVS001 is an experimental installation that allows for the generation of randomized music. Created using Processing, Arduino and Ableton Live, the project uses physical computing to interact with an audio visual interface in order to create/perform live audio visual music sequences. 

## The Interface

I wanted to use an interface that shied away from standard musical interfaces as a way to make the project more accessible and simple to use. Using standard Arduino components, I designed a physical interface which relied on basic, recognizable interacts; such as pushing a button or turning a knob. Cased in a custom 3D printed case, the physical device helps to create a connection between the user and the virtual interface.

## Visual System

The system I designed came from the idea of Pong. I wanted to take this juvenile concept and use it as a way of generating musical sequences. Inspired by the concept of musical rounds and the works of composer Steve Reich, I worked towards a musical system that would build over time, becoming more and more complex as the user progresses in the performance.
