For anyone who experienced or enjoyed the 90’s, TIMEMACHINE is an annual magazine that dedicates each publication to a year in the 90’s, including its’ music, celebrities, movies, fashion, toys, trends, and more. TIMEMACHINE differs from modern magazines by only showing content and memories from “the better days” of the past that anyone who grew up in the 90’s can relate to and reminisce about.

TIMEMACHINE is an annual publication that dedicates each issue to a year in the 90's, including its' music, celebs, fashion, politics, memorabilia, and more. The perfect magazine for anyone who enjoyed the good old days and wants to revisit the simpler times of Seinfeld, Walkmans, and iconic Hip-Hop. Included are three articles, each focusing on typography, illustration or photography. Available in print or E-pub. 

**Typographic Spread**

I created a top 40 Hip-Hop songs countdown article as my typographic spread. The art direction was meant to be playful, expressive, and colourful typography, that symbolized the song lyrics.

**Illustrative Spread**

I created a Seinfeld TV Guide as my typographic spread. The article summarizes the funniest, most iconic episodes from Seinfeld's 9 seasons. The art direction was to have similarities to old TV Guides, colorful and playful with the imagery, and descriptive of the episodes. The intention was for Seinfeld lovers and new watchers to be able to flip through and be enticed and interested in the different episodes..

**Photographic Spread**

I created a playful and educational Trolls article as my typographic spread. The art direction was bright, playful, and bold. Lining up the trolls was a fun and visually interesting way to break up the grid with imagery.
