**Problem**

The current methods of online time and productivity tracking require the userto go into an app and manually input the amount of time they spend workingon something. This system is not always accurate and does not include thepotential disturbances a user may encounter while they are doing their work.



**Solution**

Junctr is a desktop productivity-app that tracks how much time a user spends on each application. It runs in the background as the user is working so they do not have to constantly check in on it.  

The objective is to have potential users use the product intuitively without thinking. It will give a better picture on how long they spend on each programand when they do it. Moreover, it gives the user greater detail and accuracy inthe visualized data. When this happens, users will able to look at the times theyare most productive and when they are least.
