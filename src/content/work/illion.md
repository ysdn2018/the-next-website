ILLION is a brochure about a Japanese singer-songwriter, illion (Yojiro Noda). The brochure introduces illion through an interview, biography, and discography. According to illion's music style (alternative rock and pop), the brochure combines some “elements” from his songs. For example, he uses elements that are in short and fast beats which are relaxed and freestyle. It creates space for the listeners to imagine. The editorial design and typography had designed in a abstractive way in order to match illion's style.
