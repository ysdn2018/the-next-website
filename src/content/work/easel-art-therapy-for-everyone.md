_Easel_ is a mobile art therapy application that helps users improve their mental and emotional well-being. According to studies, visual art can be used as a cathartic tool for releasing difficult emotions and improving mental health. It also boosts emotional intelligence by facilitating self-reflection and encouraging users to understand themselves better. Art therapy is conducted in person between a client and a therapist. However, sessions are often expensive, underfunded by the government and difficult to access.

I believe in the value of art therapy and wish more people could reap its benefits, especially those with mental illness who cannot afford it. My solution is to create a free-to-download app that turns art therapy into a form of self-help. Using guided art therapy sessions and integrated drawing tools, users can help themselves anywhere, anytime. Easel is designed to bring art therapy to everyone.
