Easel is a smartphone application for at-home art therapy. It is be designed to help users improve their mental and emotional well-being. According to my background research, visual art can be used as a cathartic tool for releasing difficult emotions and providing emotional relief. It also improves emotional intelligence by facilitating self-reflection and encouraging users to understand themselves deeper. Art therapy is usually conducted in person between a client and a therapist. However, this application turns art therapy into a form of self-help that can be done anywhere, anytime. Easel is art therapy designed for everyone.
