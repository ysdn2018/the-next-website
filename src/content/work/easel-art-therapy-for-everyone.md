_Easel_ is a mobile art therapy application that helps users improve their mental and emotional well-being. According to studies, visual art can be used as a cathartic tool for releasing difficult emotions and providing emotional relief. It also improves emotional intelligence by facilitating self-reflection and encouraging users to understand themselves deeper.

Art therapy is usually conducted in person between a client and a therapist. However, this application turns art therapy into a form of self-help that can be done anywhere, anytime. _Easel_ is designed to bring art therapy to everyone.
