This information piece uses statistical and relational modes to display how plastic negatively effects our health, holds an impact on our lives, and causes harm to our oceans. Using a large amount of discovered research compiled behind this topic, this piece digitally illustrates and clarifies the danger behind plastic waste. 

This project started out as an informational poster, and was afterwards made digital.
