Art Basel is an annual international art festival originating in Switzerland, taking place in Basel, Miami Beach, and Hong Kong. Each show works in collaboration with the host city and its local institutions, and drawing tens of thousands of visitors to each show every year, including art directors, curators, private collectors, spectators, and students. Well-established in the sphere of arts, the exhibition is not a museum, but instead strives to challenge what contemporary art can be and what it means. Art Basel’s intent is to showcase and sell works to said parties. The show namely exhibits modern and contemporary works of art from hundreds of international galleries and collectors, as well as new and emerging artists.

Apart from being one of the world’s most exclusive art fairs, the event also operates as a social event for celebrities and the cultural elite. This serves as an opportunity for brands to host art-inspired events for their highest paying customers, as well as mark their presence among the world’s elite and the exhibition’s visitors. Art Basel is in itself a platform for business, whether it is for buying and selling art, or promoting one’s brand.

However, the branding for the art show and its website and promotional pieces appear somewhat austere and corporate. This might make sense from the art business side of things, but it really falls flat when it comes to encapsulating the show that raises eyebrows every year. Their design lies in stark contrast to the glamorous and glitzy media coverage on Art Basel you see on television every year. This seems to create a dissonance between how the public see the show and how its benefactors see the show. This problem is worth solving because as Art Basel is is an art show that pushes the boundaries of the definition of art and challenges what it means to be an artist, their website and promotional materials.

This Art Basel campaign embodies both the contemporary art found at the exhibition and the city of Miami’s vibrancy, targeted at artists and their respective audiences and prospective buyers.
