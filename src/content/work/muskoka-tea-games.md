Muskoka: Tea & Games combines fun activities and puzzles with the joy of drinking a great cup of tea. Located in Central Ontario, Muskoka is known for being a beautiful vacation spot to unwind. There’s nothing better than enjoying a cup of tea by the lake and taking a few moments to relax and enjoy the scenery.

In today’s fast paced world it can be difficult to find time to put work aside and enjoy ourselves. While Muskoka: Tea & Games may not be able to take you to the locale, it does transport you to a place of relaxation that’s reminiscent of its namesake.

Each tea packet unfolds to reveal a colouring page, origami instructions, various games and (of course) a tea bag! The set includes pencils, pencil crayons, and origami paper to complete the activities with: everything you’ll need is right at your fingertips.

An assortment of popular tea types are included, and bold colours make it easy to differentiate the flavours. The supporting container is broken off into different compartments to help organize all the contents, and once the tea is finished the container can easily be reused to organize stationary items or be recycled. It’s perfect for anyone who loves tea, games, and needs some time to relax!
