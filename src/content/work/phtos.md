Phtos is a photo app that helps people group photos in meaningful ways.

## Problem

How can you gather collectively gather photos from friends and family? Not just the photos that you didn’t take. Photos you might value in the future, but you just don’t know yet.

This problem came up when I traded phones with my friend at an asian desert place. There were pictures of me that I had forgotten about on his phone and he had the same discovery from my phone. It felt nostalgic that I could piece together these memories differently than I had remembered before. 

## Solution

The solution I came up with was a camera-first collaborative photo album app. I felt fond of the idea of designing an application that a group of college students could build. Throughout the design process, there were concerns about privacy, photo storage and marketplace value.
