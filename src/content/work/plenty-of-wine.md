Plenty of Wine app (POW) was developed with the intention of becoming a new obstacle to help tourists and/or locals within the Niagara Region feel more comfortable with most of the wineries that surround the area. Similar to how a dating app works, POW helps anyone struggling to find their perfect match. Overall, it acts as a personal wine connoisseur and provides the user with the proper knowledge needed in pairing and judging matters of taste based on oneâ€™s palate.
