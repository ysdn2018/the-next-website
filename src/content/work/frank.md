PROJECT OVERVIEW

Frank is a compassionate and insightful AI Therapist and Life Coach, offering portable and easily-accessible advice whenever and wherever users need it most. Through open dialogue, Frank offers guidance, encouragement, and support to help users accomplish their goals and overcome challenges in life. 

He is well-trained and equipped to help users combat symptoms of mood disorders, including depression and anxiety. Unlike traditional methods of therapy, Frank is there 24/7 to offer information and make suggestions specifically catered to each user and their personal needs. The more he interacts with you, the more he learns, and the better he can guide you on your own journey towards self-improvement.
