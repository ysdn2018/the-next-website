_Hello, I Am_ reflects the way I and many others were raised surrounded by two different cultures through photography and story-telling. The photos within the book portray the duality of Asian American identity through the re-contextualization of recognized American food brands or foods associated with America by pairing them with what can be considered its Asian equivalent.
