Triple Chew package provides an efficient user experience when it comes to chewing gum. Using the three influences of Reduce, Re-fill, and Recycle, this is a friendly alternative to the packaging that exists within current society. It eradicates the amount of gum littered by supplying disposable tissues inside of a re-usable package.
