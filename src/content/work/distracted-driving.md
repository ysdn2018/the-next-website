Distractions are everywhere while on the road. From our mobile phones, to make-up, to 
music, distractions will always be there; but it is up to us to either ignore it or fall into it’s trap.
 There are three types of distracted driving which are manual distractions, visual distractions, 
and focus distractions. This is a huge problem as almost 3,500 people have been killed in motor 
vehicle crashes and over 421,000 were injured in these crashes involving a distracted driver. 
These deaths can be avoided so why aren't we trying our best to make this a well-known issue
 and to stop it from happening all together? 

The first rule for driving is that we should be safe, and be aware of our surroundings and
 all the people around us. The goal from getting from point A to point B should be that everyone
 on the road is safe afterwards. Good advice I always follow is to put my phone away where I
 can’t reach it when I get in the car and don't take it out until I have made it safely to my 
destination.

I created a set of 5 posters with a focus on someones face who has been involved in an accident because of distracted driving. Each of the posters have a quote from a family member or friend of the individual on the poster. A social media account was also created for this movement of 'Take Driving Seriously'.
