The NutriLab kit and mobile application is a system designed to help combat the growing issue of nutrient deficiency in people. Using micro-technology, I have created a device that has the capabilities to screen for 8 of the most common nutrient deficiencies. This device connects to a mobile application which provides an analysis of a blood sample, in order to allow the user to ensure their nutrient levels are healthy. 

NutriLab is a 3-step system which has combined the technology behind microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices, equipped with the most reliable form of Soft Lithography, the inclusion of reactors within micro-channels, and the functionality of Intracellular Analysis in order to create a microfluidic device that tests for 8 of the most common nutrient deficiencies: iron, B12, iodine, magnesium, calcium, vitamin A, vitamin E and vitamin D.
