The Haribo repackaging project takes a house-hold-gone international brand and revitalizes an outdated character and identity to appeal to the growing consumer base around the world. With a sleek and compact new containter, the new design brings functionality and elevation to a plastic bagged product. The design uses existing equities and colours from the candy itself, refreshing a bright and youthful vibe.
