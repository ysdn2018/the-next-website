Cultivate is a festival that celebrates Northumberland County, in Southern Ontario and its food. Local chefs, restaurateurs, farmers, brew masters and food artisans come together for two days, once a year to celebrate food, drink, art and culture. Over the course of the development of this identity for Cultivate, I wanted to create an identity that was easily translated across all platforms. After many iterations I chose the symbolic approach because the icon is strong and can be really easily integrated throughout many mediums. I was inspired by Brian Steely's line drawings when I was creating the identity, which is an illustration style I hadn't experimented with before. I decided to use it because it reminded me of some craft beer label illustrations I had seen, and since this festival deals with food and drink, I felt it represented both of those well. The colours I chose were also really important to the brand as this festival marks the start of fall, and the end of the summer harvest.
