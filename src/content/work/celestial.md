This book attempts to capture the absolute essence of constellations, simplifying and emphasizing the meanings behind them. It is a compilation of all 88 constellations, featuring their coordinates, mythological stories, and the constellations themselves. This book is divided into 2 sections, Zodiacs and non-Zodiacs each including its associated myth and origin as well as its recognizable pattern or form. All Zodiac and every other non-Zodiac mythological creature or symbol are presented with gold ink which were printed using the risograph.
