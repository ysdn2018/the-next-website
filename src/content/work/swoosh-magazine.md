Swoosh Magazine gives a platform to underrepresented voices in sports, particularly in basketball. It looks at the relationship between the sport of basketball, sneaker culture, the arts, and how this interconnects with one’s identity. With limited media highlighting the female’s voice in sports, this magazine strives to showcase these voices that are passionate about their sport.
