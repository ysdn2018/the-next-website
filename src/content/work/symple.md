## Project Overview

One of the biggest challenges for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is being able to recognize and cope with symptoms such as flashbacks, insomnia, and panic attacks. SYMPLE gives people more control over their mental health by enabling them to anticipate, manage, and track their PTSD symptoms. The app is designed to accompany a wearable smart device that monitors the individualâ€™s physical and mental health.

## Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

**PTSD** is defined as _a serious mental condition caused by experiencing a shocking and dangerous event in which life is perceived to be in jeopardy. _Sexual assault, child abuse, combat, and witnessing death are all common **examples** of trauma, which can lead to PTSD. **Symptoms** of PTSD include nightmares, anxiety, insomnia, and flashbacks.

## Target Audience

According to the US Department for Veteran Affairs, 1 in 5 women and 1 in 10 men will experience PTSD at some point during their lives. Symple is designed for any individual who is currently struggling with PTSD, with a specific emphasis on individuals in the age range of **20 - 35 years old**. During this age range, people tend to encounter a lot of change in their lives. Change can create stress, which can often trigger symptoms for the first time, even if they've been lying dormant for months or years.
