## Project Overview

One of the biggest challenges for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is being able to recognize and cope with symptoms such as flashbacks, insomnia, and panic attacks. SYMPLE gives people more control over their mental health by enabling them to anticipate, manage, and track their PTSD symptoms. The app is designed to accompany a wearable smart device that monitors the individualâ€™s physical and mental health.

## Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

**PTSD** is defined as _a serious mental condition caused by experiencing a shocking and dangerous event in which life is perceived to be in jeopardy. _Sexual assault, child abuse, combat, and witnessing death are all common **examples** of trauma, which can lead to PTSD. **Symptoms** of PTSD include but are not limited to: nightmares, anxiety, insomnia, and flashbacks. These symptoms can greatly hinder a person from functioning and participating in regular daily activities.

## Target Audience

According to the US Department for Veteran Affairs, 1 in 5 women and 1 in 10 men will experience PTSD at some point during their lives. Symple is designed for any individual who is currently struggling with PTSD, with a specific emphasis on individuals in the age range of **20 - 35 years old**. During this age range, people tend to encounter a lot of change in their lives. Change can create stress, which can often trigger symptoms for the first time, even if they've been lying dormant for months or years.

## Key Features

SYMPLE enables individuals with PTSD to do three key things: anticipate their symptoms, track their symptoms over time, and manage their symptoms as they occur in real-time.

_**Anticipate Symptoms**_

SYMPLE allows individuals to monitor unique risk factors such as isolation, inactivity, and fatigue, and suggests actions they can take to reduce their risk of experiencing a PTSD symptom. The app shows the user how much each action will reduce risk by, enabling them to make informed decisions about how they choose to mitigate their risk.

_**Track Symptoms Over Time**_

SYMPLE also allows individuals to document their symptoms' frequency and severity over time, enabling them to observe patterns and be encouraged by their progress as they continue to learn about how to recognize and manage their symptoms.

_**Manage Symptoms in Real-Time**_

SYMPLE's final feature is it's symptom management function. If the user is experiencing a symptom, they can manually  or automatically be taken into the management flow. The app takes them through a sequence which asks them a few simple questions about their symptom(s), and provides them with some customized recommendations for coping mechanisms to help them get through the episode.

## Why Symple Matters

SYMPLE acts as an affordable, accessible first step for individuals to begin learning about their PTSD symptoms. Ideally it can be used in conjunction with professional therapy, but since therapy services aren't affordable for many individuals, it serves as a way to provide individuals with personal agency by giving them access to their own mental health data. The app enables individuals to move from simply reacting to their symptoms to understanding, mitigating, and eventually managing their symptoms in a way that is sustainable and empowering.
