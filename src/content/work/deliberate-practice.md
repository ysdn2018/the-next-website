This is an experimental project where the notion of improvement through practice is explored particularly through the repetition of a particular skill. This project attempts to challenge and shift the perception of quantitatively measured knowledge to qualitative skill and to indicate that practice is still relevant and underestimated. 

In this case, the legitimacy of Erik Ericsson's deliberate practice and 10,000 hour theory is put to the test. The practice of repetitively drawing a calligraphy ornament 10,000 times is performed in order to prove that skill can be obtained through deliberate practice, and that it can improve skill in particular domains.
