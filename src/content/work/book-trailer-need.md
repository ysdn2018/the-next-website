The book I have chosen for this project is one I’ve read many times called Need by Carrie Jones. It was one of the first ones I thought of, that wouldn’t be too hard to film because I wouldn’t need to have a human involved. I am going to be filming significant objects and environments that the book references to make the viewer interested in what is so special about this objects.

The book is about a girl named Zara White who suspects a creepy guy is semi-stalking her. She has an obsession with phobias and is constantly naming them. She has been acting weird since her stepfather died and is sent to Maine to live with her grandmother to get her to open up. Sadly, the semi-stalker is not a figment of Zara’s overactive imagination. He follows her and leaves an eerie trail of gold dust everywhere he places his foot. There is something not human in the small town of Maine and all heads are turned toward Zara. The book delivers romance, suspense, and a creature you’d never thought you’d fear.
