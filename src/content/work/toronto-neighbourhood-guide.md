This 36’ x 36’ folding pamphlet outlines the best and worst neighbourhoods to live in, or visit based on the crime rate, housing, residents, and jobs/money.  It also contains information on how some of the neighbourhoods got their names and a timeline of how Toronto became known as “The City of Neighbourhoods”. This was designed for people who are moving to the city and are trying to figure out what neighbourhood they should live in based on their needs.
