> bloom is a series of constraint based tools for growing your creativity.

Over my final year, I've been researching the effect of our tool on how we create. The more I read, the more it was evident just how much our tools are influencing us, so why not make them influence us for the better? Bloom is the answer to this.

Bloom consists of three main tools: _Collect, View & Change_.

# _View<sup>desktop app</sup>_
A desktop app for restricted viewing of your creative inventory.

View allows you to view your visual inventory without being too heavily inspired by any one thing. Simply paste a link to an Are.na channel, Pinterest board or drag a folder from your computer to add your inspiration. 

View constrains you to only move forward through your inspiration, with modes for infinite scrolling, randomized click-through, or timer-based viewing.

I've already build an alpha version of Bloom that I've been using personally. I'll be open-sourcing it and having a free download availble soon.
