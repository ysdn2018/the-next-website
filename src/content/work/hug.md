The current process for post-secondary students to talk with a professional counsellor at school is draining and the waiting time could last longer than four weeks. Hug is designed to help students book counselling appointments online and keep them occupied during the wait. It also holds an online platform for students who are experiencing mental health distress to connect with each other.
