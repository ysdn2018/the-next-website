This poster was made a for a fictitious design conference involving Marian Bantjes, Jonathan Puckey, and Martin Woodtli. The goal for this poster was to try and capture Martin Woodtliâ€™s essence by using bold and bright colours and to relate the poster to the city of New York in which the conference was taking place.
