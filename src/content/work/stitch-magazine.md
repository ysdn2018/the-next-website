Stitch is a fashion magazine based around thrifted and vintage clothing that explores current topics related to second-hand items, the history and significance of clothing pieces, the sociology of fashion, as well as providing a styling guide for pairing vintage clothing with modern styles to make them wearable in everyday contexts.

This image heavy editorial is aimed towards fashion loving young adults. I tried to make every spread dynamic and fun to read by playing with the relationship between text, image and white space.

I custom designed the typography for half of the headlines including the masthead which was designed to have a handmade feel, almost like it was cut out of paper with small notches in the heavy, geometric shapes creating the letter forms.
