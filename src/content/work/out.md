OUT is a kit that helps facilitate the conversation between an LGBTQ+ youth and a loved one that they are coming out to. The kit comes with tools designed to present information about the LGBTQ+ community in an easy-to-understand way as well as items that allow the user to explain who they are specifically and how they feel without needing to identify with a label. 

The items that come in the box are:

A Guidebook

An Identity Scale

Buttons
