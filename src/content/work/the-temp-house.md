The Temp House is a modular venue that is designed with intimacy in mind. Its purpose is to improve live music experiences, and separates itself from traditional performance spaces. The venue's modularity allows artists to reimagine the contexts in which they perform, encouraging new ways of conceptualizing performance in a meaningful way.
