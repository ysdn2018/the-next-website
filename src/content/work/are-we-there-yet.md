# The Rise and Evidence of Fictional Dystopia Today

The word dystopia is defined as “an imagined place or state in which everything is unpleasant or bad, typically a totalitarian or environmentally degraded one” (Oxford Dictionary, 2017). Dystopias can be demonstrated in politics, social spheres, or the environment we live in. In fiction, dystopia is used as a motive for cautionary tales, which aims to “provide fresh perspectives on problematic social and political practices that might otherwise be taken for granted or considered natural and inevitable” (Booker, 1994). Today, our generation is flooded with various interpretations and examples of reaching peak dystopia. From the rise of Donald Trump, global warming, or even increased popularity of artificial intelligence, we have all faced the realization that we are seeing signs of dystopia.
