A book dedicated to the avid do-it-yourself enthusiast, UPCYCLE aims to reduce waste by challenging viewers to explore ways to transform old household products to new again. By strictly using illustrations and typography, the look of the final product is up to the viewers imagination and creativity.

Something that inspires me as a designer is taking an idea and creating something completely new. By making something new again it is not about replacing the old, but simply improving to make it better or increase its value. Upcycle is a book dedicated to those who seek this passion as well as those who do not like to see good things go to waste. By completing these tasks you get the chance to give something a second life.
