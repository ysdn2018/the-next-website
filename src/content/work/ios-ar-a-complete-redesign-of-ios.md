Everyone uses an iPhone differently, every user has different apps, needs, and ways they use and interact with their digital content on iOS devices. My goal for my iOS redesign is to address the lack of personalization and give users the ability to customize their phone as they see fit. Next, as I believe Augmented Reality is a technology that will be fundamental to the future of digital interaction, and may one day replace the smartphone, I wanted to incorporate AR into the core of the iOS experience while being intuitive and functional. As a result, this redesign will feature Augmented Reality working together with a constantly learning Siri at the core of the operating system, allowing for new innovative ways to use an iPhone.
