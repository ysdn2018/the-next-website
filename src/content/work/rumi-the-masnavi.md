Rumi is often regarded as the best selling poet in the United States. There’s a plethora of adultarated single-line translations lining bookstore shelves, recited at weddings, and shared over the internet. “The Rumi that people love is very beautiful in English, and the price you pay is to cut the culture and religion,” says Jawid Mojaddedi, a scholar of early Sufism and an excellent translator of Persian literature. This redesign of ‘The Masnavi, Book One’ takes the most faithful verse translation of the original text and complements the elegance of Rumi’s poetry with the richness of Islamic culture.
