This bilingual festival rebrand playfully illustrates the vibrancy, movement, rhythm, and community that Afrofest represents, as well as the festival's activities such as drumming, dancing, music, crafts, food, and more!  Afrofest is the largest free African music Festival in North America, showcasing the best in African music, art, crafts, culture and food in an inclusive, vibrant and positive community festival.

Afrofest's atmosphere is busy and exciting, with a lot of great things happening at once. It is full of rhythm and dancing, laughing, eating, shopping and culture. In my redesign I aim to create the feeling of a community, people coming together, celebrating, appreciating and learning about something very positive and unique. I want to express the reward of an experience such as Afrofest, and establish the feeling of “home” for some, and “exploring and learning” for others. My design system is bilingual in English and Swahili, since Swahili is the most spoken language in Africa, I wanted to add another element of the culture in the design.

**Key Words**
