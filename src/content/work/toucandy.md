_Toucandy_ is an environmentally and economically friendly children’s candy packaging that minimizes waste and provides a “second life” for the target audience to use.

The goal of the project was to create a package design for an existing product that would function in a sustainable and beautiful way. _Toucandy_ is candy for the target audience of young, imaginative children who love to play with their food. The design is made to be sustainable as it is made without the use of plastics—just paper. The package employs the use of folding techniques so that only a single swipe of glue is required to keep it together as well as the fact that it can be unfolded to create a bird hat for the consumer. Both parts of the box are collapsable and lightweight—thus saving economic resources on the transport of the material.
