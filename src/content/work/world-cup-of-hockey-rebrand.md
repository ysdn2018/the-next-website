# Introduction

After a 12-year hiatus, the 2016 World Cup of Hockey (WCOH) returns as an event. According to [the official WCOH website](https://www.wch2016.com/), “The 2016 World Cup of Hockey will feature eight teams competing for a best-on-best international hockey championship: The eight teams participating in the 2016 World Cup of Hockey are Team Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden, USA, Europe and North America. It is expected that more than 150 of the best players in the NHL will participate in this tournament”. This year, the main event will be hosted at the Air Canada Centre (ACC) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The tournament is scheduled to start on September 17 and end on October 1, 2016. 

While the event is largely themed after international hockey, there are other various fan engagements available, such as [The Scotiabank World Cup of Hockey Fan Village](https://www.wch2016.com/info/world-cup-of-hockey-fan-village), which is hosted at The Distillery District in Toronto. The Fan Village is split up to two venues: The East Fan Village, and Distillery Fan Village. This family-friendly festival is a ten-day celebration, in contrast to the main games, which will be hosted from September 16 – 25. The festival site promises that fans, “will celebrate not only the sport of hockey but the food, music and culture of all participating hockey nations and will feature a diverse mix of programming, designed for fans of all ages…” (WCOH, 2016).
