Virtual Gestures is a series of interactive objects examining reverse skeumorphism. It explores how immaterial objects look when given the sense of materiality and feel when digital gestures of scrolling, dragging, resizing and clicking are performed physically. By bringing the digital to the physical world, the digital is radically transformed into bizarre behaviours and nonsensical objects, revealing the gap between how we experience these two distinct yet intertwined worlds.
