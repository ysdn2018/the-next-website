Virtual Gestures is a series of experiments that examine the relationships and tensions between the digital and physical. Screen-based gestures are performed physically with these materialized digital artefacts as a form of reverse skeumorphism. In carrying out this translation, it is hoped that we will uncover a deeper understanding of these interactions and the digital environment, revealing the gap between how we experience these two distinct yet intertwined worlds.Â 

The full case study will be available at [soojinna.com](soojinna.com).
