As approximately one in four adults suffer from some form of mental illness, a large portion of the population need mental help support. I was tasked to design a smartphone application to help people with mental health issue's and promote healing through community and self-help methods. ReachOut is a mental health support app with a focus on connecting with others and promoting self-help.
