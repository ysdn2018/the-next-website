**OVERVIEW**

With approximately one in four adults suffering from some form of mental illness, a large portion of the population needs help talking about their problems. The challenge was to design a smartphone application aiming to help people with mental health issue's and promote healing through community and self-help methods. I was also tasked at creating a brand identity guideline book and accompanying website for the application.
