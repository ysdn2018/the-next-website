**OVERVIEW**

With approximately one in four adults suffering from some form of mental illness, a large portion of the population needs help talking about their problems. The challenge was to design a smartphone application aiming to help people with mental health issue's and promote healing through community and self-help methods. I was also tasked at creating a brand identity guideline book and accompanying website for the application.



**TARGET AUDIENCE**

With a topic as broad as mental health that affects people in every facet of life, this application had to be accessible by all with an easy to navigate interface. The primary users of this application are individuals seeking easily accessible support and advice from people who have been in the same situations as themselves. This varies from person to person but can be anything from being stressed or anxious about managing both school and work, to a person with OCD who finds it difficult to find someone who understands what they are going through.
