Voyager is a concept for an augmented reality, educational game app meant to inspire the little astronaut in elementary students and older players alike. The story follows you, The Voyager, as you embark on missions to uncover the greatest mysteries of our solar system and the universe. The animations shown in the video bring this app to life.

Full case study in progress.
