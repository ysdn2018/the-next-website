![Yokko Mobile Application](/assets/yokko2.jpg)

In this project, I have created an application that revolves around pregnancy. Through the use of wearable technology, a mother will be able to track the heart rate, movement, and be given a visual of the baby to be. Through the use of minimalistic imagery and representation, this application will allow mothers to track their pregnancy in a more efficient way.
