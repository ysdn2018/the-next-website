The connection between a mother and a baby begins from the moment of conception. With the mobile application _Yokko_, women are able to better connect with their children throughout their journey as one. The application is designed to track the baby’s size, weight,  heart rate, movement, and positioning. A wearable strap accompanies the application to ensure the data is personalized. This data is then visualized via the image of an egg - as the baby develops, so does the imagery. _Yokko_ enables parents carefully monitor their baby’s development without having to leverage medical personnel. In addition, if complications do occur, _Yokko_ can help those expecting discover complications sooner and action them more readily. _Yokko_ is available on both mobile and watch applications.
