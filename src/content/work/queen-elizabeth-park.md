Staff leaders from the Queen Elizabeth Park Community Centre reported that members expressed frustration with the Centre's online studio schedule. The website is complicated and difficult to use, so members resorted to dropping in. Since studios would often fill up, this lead to members having to turn around and head back home.

The staff leaders posed a challenge to our group as part of a User Centered Design course: “As a studio member, when can I access the studios?” 

My team would conduct user research, build a working prototype, and lead an on-site user testing session. Our solution made the online experience more intuitive and touched on improving other aspects of the studio experience as well.
