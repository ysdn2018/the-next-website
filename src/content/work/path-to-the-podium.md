Path to the Podium is a satirical Board game based on real-life events and challenges that athletes around the world face in their careers. Players play as a celebrated athlete of a minority background, and encounter trials along their way to reach the top. By drawing instanced situations and making their way through them, players can learn more about the social institution of Sport. The goal of this Baord game is to shed light on issues that underprivileged communities (even famous athletes) go through, and to encourage and inspire participation in unconventional activities such as fencing and boxing.
