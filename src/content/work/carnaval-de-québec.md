This rebrand for Carnaval de Quebéc represents the traditions of Quebéc City and the winter season, the feeling of warmth that the event evokes in visitors' hearts and the magic that the carnival brings to downtown Quebéc. The illustrative style is family friendly, playful and exciting; embodying the atmosphere of the carnival itself.

# WINTER    WARMTH    MAGIC

I kept these three words in mind during my entire process. For the new branding of the festival I wanted to design something that represented the traditions of Quebec City and it's winter season, the feeling of warmth that the carnival brings to its visitors' hearts and the magic that the carnival brings to downtown Quebec. I wanted a design that would keep the interest of the festival's yearly visitors while also captivating the attention of new visitors or tourists.  I used an illustrative style to create multiple different scenes of families enjoying winter activities that would be done at the carnival. The new branding is family friendly, playful and exciting; embodying the atmosphere of the carnival itself.

In keeping a playful and child friendly vibe, I used typefaces for my pieces that reflected these feelings. For the title of the carnival I made use of a webfont called SnowCaps that definitely goes with the winter weather theme. For body copy I chose Varela Rounded because the rounded edges give off more of a childish charm.

The colour theme of the whole projects involves a harmonious palette of purples, blues and greens that really represents the cold winter weather. I used an accent colour of a bright red to highlight main parts of the imagery and to bring in the colours of Canada to reflect the traditions of the carnival.

I developed a promotion booklet to provide history and additional information about the festival. I also designed a smaller and more portable fold-out map and event schedule that festival goers would be able to easily carry with them. To add a bit of extra fun to the fold-out map I also included instructions on the back for children or families to follow in order to cut the map into a paper snowflake when they are finished using it.

For merchandise it was important to design items that were relevant to the festival and its setting. I chose to make use of the winter weather and develop some products that would be unique to this festival. Because most of the carnival's activities are outdoors I decided on reusable hand warmers to keep people outside and comfortable for longer and mitten clips do reduce the amount of dropped mittens for children and adults. I also designed a children's t-shirt for parents to dress their children in.
