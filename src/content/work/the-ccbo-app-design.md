The Cannabis Control Board of Ontario (CCBO) mobile app provides users with the resource to reserach, explore and learnabout everything marijuana. 

There is a lot to know about marijuana, so the app aims to help users research and explore marijuana products and information. Some features include beingable to filter through strains targeting certain medical symptoms, and being up to date about currentmarijuana news and articles. It also would allow for patients who have been prescribed marijuana to managetheir prescriptions.
