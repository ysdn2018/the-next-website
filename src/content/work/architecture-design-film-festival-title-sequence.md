Architecture & Design Film Festival in Winnipeg is an existing film festival, in which the screened films focus on the importance of architecture and design in everyday life, covering a range of design-oriented topics from architecture and urban design to graphics & product design. The goal of this project is to convey the essence of architecture and design through 20 seconds of introduction. Since the architecture and graphic design were based on the construction of basic shapes, I decided use an abstract approach using basic shapes and lines that highlighted the principles of architecture and design and created unity within the two fields. Black and white colour were used to avoid distraction from the structure, in the hope of contrasting the idea of architecture & design.
