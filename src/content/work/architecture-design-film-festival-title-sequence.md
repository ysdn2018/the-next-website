Architecture & Design Film Festival in Winnipeg is an existing film festival. The films that will be screened in the festival will focus on the importance of architecture and design in everyday life, cover a range of design-oriented topics from architecture and urban design to graphics & product design. The goal of this project is to convey the essence of architecture and design through the 20 seconds of introduction. Architecture and graphic design are mainly based on the construction of basic shapes. Therefore, I decided to create an abstract approach by using basic shapes and lines to emphasize the principles of architecture and design, which also create unity within the two fields.
