Swish is a web extension and a mobile application that allows its users to shop easier online. The way _Swish_ works is it complies all your wish lists across online stores as long as you are logged into it. Users are also notified if the item they saved is either low on stock, went on sale, if there's a better deal from a different store and so on. With Swish, tracking your parcels becomes easier. You can pay for your shipping fees through the product and also authorize your parcels by pre-signing off your parcels. Another key feature Swish offers to its users accessible return and exchange policies notifying them if their return policy expires.
