Did you know factory farms produce more greenhouses gases than the world's entire transportation sector combined? Animal agriculture is extremely destructive on the environment yet it is a little known fact. The challenge was to design an informational infographic that would raise awareness on factory farming.

I began the project by researching and collecting data on animal agriculture. Despite finding a lot of alarming information, I decided not to turn them into "scare tactics" like other protest organizations. I wanted my guide to be friendly and non-threatening, especially since my target audience is families and school children. In order to do this, I utilized a soft natural colour palette and bright illustrations with a humanistic touch.

The final product is a paper handout that folds out into a 24" x 36" informational poster. I also created an interactive infographic for an added layer of audience engagement. I used the folds of the paper and a long-scrolling page to tell a curated story about factory farming. After looking at the designs, viewers will feel more informed on the topic.
