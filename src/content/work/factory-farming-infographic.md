Did you know factory farms produce more greenhouses gases than the world’s entire transportation sector combined?

Animal agriculture is extremely destructive on the environment yet it's not a commonly known fact. My infographic attempts to raise awareness on the environmental consequences of factory farming. Rather than use traditional scare tactics, I took a humanistic design approach that utilized storytelling and illustrations to present the information in a friendly, digestible format. The infographic is available in two formats: a 24” x 36” fold-out poster and an interactive document for mobile devices.
