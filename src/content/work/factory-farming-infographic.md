Did you know factory farms produce more greenhouses gases than the world's entire transportation sector combined? Animal agriculture is extremely destructive on the environment yet it is a little known fact. My informational infographic attempts to raise awareness on factory farming.

I began the project by researching and collecting data on animal agriculture. Despite finding a lot of alarming information, I decided not to turn them into traditional "scare tactics" like other protest organizations. I wanted my guide to be friendly and non-threatening, especially since my target audience are families and school children. With this in mind, I used a soft, natural colour palette and bright illustrations that bring a humanistic touch. 

The final product is a paper handout that folds out into a 24" x 36" informational poster. I also reformatted the poster into an interactive infographic that can be viewed on mobile devices.
