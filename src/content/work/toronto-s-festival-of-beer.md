This well organized, popular festival of beer is one that cannot be missed. Hosted by experts of the brewing craft from around the world, Toronto’s Festival of Beer features 333 different brands of beer on site with 100 brewers. This is Canada’s premier celebration of the golden beverage, being one of the longest running and most popular festival in Toronto for adults. With the general admission of 39.50, this festival has cheap beer, a complimentary small mug, and entertainment for you to enjoy. This event is presented by the Beer Store every year and 2017 is this events 150th anniversary.  The important words I chose for this event are refreshing, fulfilling, sociable, intoxicating, stimulating, hearty, unique. These words are the vibe I wanted to give off with this rebranding. I designed a poster, a website, and a pamphlet for this event.
