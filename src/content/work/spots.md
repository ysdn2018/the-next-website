## Project Overview

If you are in a big city, finding a new place to eat can be overwhelming. Researching different options can take forever, and itâ€™s always hard to know if reviews are trust-worthy. SPOTS makes it quick, fun, and easy to discover local places to eat, drink, and hang out. The app connects you to restaurants, bars, and cafes that are close to your current location, and it provides you with curated recommendations based on your existing habits and preferences.

## Target Audience

SPOTS is designed for people are who looking to try new places in the moment, either in their home city or abroad. 

## Key Features

SPOTS enables individuals to do three key things: discover new places, compare their options effortlessly, and fine tune their Spots to suit their tastes.

**_Fine Tune Spots to Suit Your Tastes_**

In the detailed Spot view, users can rate Spots that they've visited. The user-provided ratings feed into and help to refine the app's future recommendations.

## Why Spots Matters

Although there are plenty of apps and websites that rate and recommend different food and drink venues, they can take lots of time to navigate and understand. SPOTS makes finding new places easy by showing users one nearby option at a time, and using their own preferences and social connections to support the recommendations.
