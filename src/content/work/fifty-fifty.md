6 layers. 32 possible outcomes. 1 final outcome. Fifty-Fifty questions the nature of choice and chance in a series of unconventionally layered French folds. The reader is presented 2 choices and is invited to interact by tearing one of the folds for each layer. Each layer presents a pair of new choices, and eventually the readerâ€™s choices will result in a final outcome.
