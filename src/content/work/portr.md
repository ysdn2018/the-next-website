## Summary

A social platform for individuals to recommend small business’ within their social networks. Essentially taking out the algorithm behind recommendation systems and replacing it with human opinion. Thus making personal content naturally for users.

## The Problem

Recommendation systems have no way of knowing what content you are only watching temporarily and content you personally enjoy. The knowledge gap within these systems causes a lack of transparency in their operations causing a missing humanizing factor; personal interaction.

## Strategy

Utilizing a list of methods and theories, the design of the app was created using a “research, design, test, iterate” process. To create a product that focused on delivering a true product experience while being user-centred, we utilized self-determinism theory for the core user experience and features, P.A.C.T analysis for developing user personas and demographics, M.O.S.C.O.W method for creating a minimal viable product, and prototyping / user testing to iterate on the minimal viable product.

## Deliverables

The final deliverable consisted of a high fidelity prototype along with a pitch presentation of the product concept.

## Conclusion

![Portr User Interface Screens](/assets/portr_hifi_wireframes.jpg)

Building the design system for Portr had taught me valuable lessons towards psychographics, user tendencies, and user interface design for frequent behaviour. Overall the project was a interesting topic dealing with constraining the influence technology has over the user experience of a product. How that works to our advantage, and how it might not.

Upon completion of the project, the pitch was received positively, generating genuine interest in the development of the product.
