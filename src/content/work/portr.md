Portr is an app that places recommendations in the hands of users instead of algorithms. It allows users to send and receive recommended locations from their friends and family. This will help the user build a more personalized directory that they can trust. It will provide people with intimate and insightful recommendations from their closest social network rather then having to relying on the ratings of strangers.
