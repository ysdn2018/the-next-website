For editorial design, we were tasked with creating a magazine and I chose to create a magazine that Looked at Space Through the Lens of Art, Design & Science.

The essence of the magazine was to look at something that we often mostly visualize as cold and sterile and to give it a level of warmth that would make it easier for people to identify with the problems and solution found in the world of liveable space design.
