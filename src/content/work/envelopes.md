The Envelope System is a popular budgeting technique advocated for by personal finance gurus. The idea is that, to prevent overspending your budgets, you make a set of physical envelopes and label them with common spending categories like "Grocery," "Coffee," "Transit," etc. You would then stuff each envelope with the amount of cash you aim to spend in a given week. Once the envelope is empty, then its time to stop spending.

This is the type of hacked together solution we've arrived at knowing that there is such a disconnection between our credit card spending and our budgeting attempts. When swiping our cards to buy stuff, we're not immediately made aware of each purchases impact; we have to open a separate app (or, more commonly, spreadsheet) to view how well we've stayed in budget.

Envelopes is a mobile application that attempts to virtualize the envelope system. The idea is to create an instant feedback loop between spending and budgeting through an intuitive interface design. Add credit cards, set budgets, and make purchases directly in-app, and instantly see when you've overspent. In doing so, you're then better able to scale back, stay on top of your spending, and ultimately achieve your financial goals.
