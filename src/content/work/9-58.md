9.58 is a magazine that is named after the fastest world record in track and field history, that was broken by the legendary Jamaican sprinter, Usain Bolt. The book looks at the life of sprinter into how he became the fastet man in the world. The magazine is driven by the idea of motion, which has been explored through the combination of both coloured and black white images, alongside the experimentation of type treatment.
