_In creating a package that can contain a minimum of four products, I designed a robotics set for girls to interest them in STEM related pathways for future education and career choices._



**the problem**

Even in 2018, there is still a diversity issue amongst stem post-secondary programs and careers. The focus of this project was to address the gender differences in stem. Especially in Canada, little to no change has really occurred over 30 years. From the mid-80s to 2015, there has only been a 2% increase from 20% to 22% of women amongst the STEM workforce. The best way to make a change is to influence girls while they are young as show them that there are no barriers for them to be interested in topics that have been largely populated by boys and men who are commonly unaffected by society and sexism. As well as targeting early childhood influencers like teachers and parents, to provide with other opportunities outside of dolls.

The problem I created for myself was to design a robotics set could appeal to girls, effectively educate, and inspire them to keep on creating and build in the future. The subject of this project is of great significance because girls should feel empowered to pursue anything they wish without the fear of not fitting in or being treated differently. Having a product such as this, is even more relevant in present times.

**the process**

For most projects, I begin researching as much as I can and making sketches. Looking into robots and the gender gap within stem, while sketching early ideas of what the potential package could look.Thinking about a name for the robotics set that was both relevant and meaningful to the potential users. Settling on CiRKET, utilizing a part of my first name with the word “circuit,” leaving the lowercase “i” to illustrate that we changing the world with one girl at a time.

**the challenges**

With most packaging projects many challenges arose, the most prominent being the structure of the package. I created several prototypes before finally picking the prototype shown below. Another challenge was incorporating information design for the supplementary elements.

By continuously iterating and looking for inspiration outside of design did aid in resolving most of the challenges I faced. As well as speaking to peers.



**solution**

I was able to create a robotics set with more than the minimum of four items and designed something that has the potential to spark an interest within girls who weren’t really offered or provided these opportunities.
