Currently in Canada, there is no system in place for people to keep track of the vaccines they have received. The paper-based system means that individuals have to update their immunization record on anÂ individual basis, which can be easily lost.

_Vax_ is a digital immunization platform that allows individuals and families to keep track of their vaccinations in one place. It allows people to understand what vaccinations they may need for work, school, travel or personal health.
