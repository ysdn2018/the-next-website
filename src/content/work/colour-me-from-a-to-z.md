Colour me from A â€“ Z is a colouring book created for designers, artists, and anyone with any sort of creativity. Each page is single-sided with perforated edges making it easier for removal. Once removed from the book, the pages can be coloured, painted, drawn on, or anything you wish to do. The pages can then be displayed solo as a monogram, or combined with other letters to create a word. 

This project was created to test the boundaries between art and design and prove that they have the possibility to coexist together.
