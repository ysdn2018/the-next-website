  Manushi aims to produce engaging design that ensures that the individualâ€™s
  initial introduction to a design matches the intended design experience.
  Manushi believes that the best work emerges when various disciplines
  intersect, and that research is at the base of a good design work and should
  rule the form of the delivery. Manushi has one goal in her design process and
  that is to understand users enough to be able to step into their shoes during
  the design process. There can be dozens of great ideas but as a designer,
  Manushi likes to find what her ideal solution will be and why it makes for an
  effective and strong design.
