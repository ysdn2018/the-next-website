  Design is about solving problems. Sean believes that design thinking is the
  method through which we can learn and understand the world. Through careful
  observation and immersing yourself in a problem, Sean believes you can develop
  the pieces that come together to form a variety of solutions.

  As a multidisciplinary designer, Sean aims to continually refine his technical
  skills and explore new and exciting ideas. Paired with his endless desire to
  create, Sean pieces together his thoroughly considered ideas to form a greater
  whole.
