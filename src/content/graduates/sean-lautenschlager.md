intro: >-
  Design is about solving problems. Sean believes that design thinking is the
  method through which we can learn and understand the world. Through careful
  observation and immersing one self in the problem, one can develop the pieces
  which can come together to form possible solutions.

  While the tools for creation may change, as a multidisciplinary designer, Sean
  aims to apply his continually re nable technical skills and endless obsession
  with creating to discover new ways of constructing individual pieces which  t
  together into a great whole.
