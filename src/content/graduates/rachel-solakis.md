intro: >-
  Rachel is not afraid to make mistakes and learn from them. Without failure,
  there is no progress and design only gets better by building on whatâ€™s been
  seen in the past. She believes in trusting the process, taking risks, and not
  being afraid to let your design get a little weird.
