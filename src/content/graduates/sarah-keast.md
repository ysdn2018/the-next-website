intro: >+
  Sarah has always been an imaginative person,  and has been creating since the
  day she can remember. Whether it be colouring the walls when she was five, to
  painting on people when she was seventeen, Sarah has always had a passion for
  bringing her ideas to life. Sarah’s creativity is a large portion of who she
  is, and this carries through in every project she encounters. 


  Although many components of design have made her leave her comfort zone and
  take on new challenges, an area that has definitely broadened her artistic
  perspective is product design. Being apart of YSDN has taught her more about
  herself and has shown her her place in the world. Sarah’s interpersonal
  skills, as well as her ability to build a stronger connection with those
  involved in her designs will forever be strengthened by what this program has
  taught her.
