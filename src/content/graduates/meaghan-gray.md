intro: >-
  Meaghan focuses on design thinking and generating design that is accommodating
  to the people it serves. Rather than being focused on profitability, Meaghan
  believes in pushing boundaries of thought and developing innovative ideas.
  Research is important to her, and it makes up a major portion of the work she
  does. She brainstorms, asks questions, and prototypes every angle to achieve
  the best solution. Meaghan is not afraid to take risks. Understanding the
  demographic she is designing for, and their needs and concerns is one of her
  major goals in the designs she creates. Meaghan is not afraid to take the path
  less travelled and refuses to conform to expected standards of practice in
  design. She is both rational and conceptual. Meaghan cares more about what
  works than what sells. What she creates is not nearly as important as the
  people it is created for. Meaghan embraces technological development and
  creates innovative design in tandem with these advancements. Her design is
  honest and does not manipulate the consumer with promises it cannot keep. She
  endeavours to keep her work environmentally friendly and actively contributes
  to the preservation of the environment. Meaghan conserves resources and works
  in a way that creates minimal stress on the environment. She believes that
  good design is as little design as possible. Meaghanâ€™s focus is to provide
  simplicity whenever possible. She operates both in print and digital and has a
  deep understanding of production. Meaghan is constantly growing and learning
  with design and keeps an open mind to new ideas and opportunities. She always
  strives to be innovative and cutting edge to create works that are timeless.
