  Katharine believes in the creative process of design; experimentation,
  ideation, research, and exploration are all important factors that inform her
  design practice. She feels that exploring new possibilities and different ways
  to create can greatly benefit the final outcome of a piece of art or design. 

  As well, Katharine has a great passion for illustration and photography and
  loves to integrate that into her work. When Katharine isn't designing you can
  find her drawing, listening to her favourite podcasts, or out exploring
  exciting places with her friends.
