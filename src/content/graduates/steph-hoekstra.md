  The first time Steph saw the term “graphic designer” was as an occupation
  title for a contestant on the Bachelor. Unsure what it was, she did a quick
  search on Wikipedia, and immediately something clicked. At the time of that
  search, she was in her early twenties. had just completed a Bachelors in
  History and Classics, and while she enjoyed her time spent doing it, there was
  something missing. She loved research and telling stories, but writing it out
  in text wasn’t enough. Graphic design opened up a new world of story-telling
  potential. It allowed her to support a story visually, to explore new tools
  for explaining data, and make stories more accessible for those that don’t
  enjoy reading blocks of text. Steph enjoys being playful and making people
  smile with design. It’s also been a comfort to her knowing that the Bachelor
  has produced at least one lasting relationship: Steph and design.
