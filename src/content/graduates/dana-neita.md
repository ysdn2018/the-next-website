intro: >-
  Dana is a passionate creator, who believes that design consists of ideas that
  are translated into creating something that is easy and effective for all
  users to grasp, understand and trust. Born and raised in the Caribbean, it has
  taught her the value of culture and people and with that she finds visual
  communication as key factor in design. Dana enjoys working with a dynamic
  colour palette, simple shapes and closely cropped images to express a language
  that is powerful enough to read without having to depend on words to tell a
  story.
hobbies: ' modern contemporary dancing'
music: >-
  Some sweet reggae music on any occasion  to relax the mind. Other than that,
  dancehall music, a bit of hip hop and I canâ€™t leave out the rhythm of soca,
  especially around carnival season
