intro: >-
  Anam is a strategic, multidisciplinary designer with passion in typography,
  motion graphics and illustration. Everything she creates needs to take the end
  users experience into account. Anam wanted to do something that will excites
  her and give her an opportunity to learn everyday. The pleasure Anam gets from
  the activities she perform in graphic designing involving arts and creative
  expressions are like the two sides of the same coin to her. She cannot have
  one without the other. Graphic designing gave Anam real freedom of
  self-expression and an opportunity to explore something she may not otherwise
  get a chance to do. Anam thinks being a designer has increased her thirst for
  learning. The more she know, the more she wants to know and the better her
  solutions.
