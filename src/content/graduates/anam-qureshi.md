intro: >-
  Anam is a strategic, multidisciplinary designer with passion in typography,
  motion graphics and print. Everything she creates needs to take the end users
  experience into account. She likes math and love being creative. Anam wanted
  to do something that will excites her and give her an opportunity to learn
  everyday. The pleasure Anam gets from the activities she perform in graphic
  designing involving arts and creative expressions are like the two sides of
  the same coin to her. She cannot have one without the other. Graphic designing
  gave Anam real freedom of self-expression and an opportunity to explore
  something she may not otherwise get a chance to do. Anam thinks being a
  designer has increased her thirst for learning. The more she know, the more
  she wants to know and the better her solutions.
