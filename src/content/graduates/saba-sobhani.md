intro: >
  Saba has been pursuing a career as a graphic designer ever since the age of
  12, fuelled by curiosity and a desire to learn about how to communicate with
  massive audiences. While in school, this fuel has transformed into an
  eagerness to constantly push the boundaries of visual culture, always
  wondering about all the possibilities that exist and that have yet to be
  uncovered. The process of discovery through making - which is employed in
  every project - has helped him develop creative that has a lasting impression,
  with the ultimate goal of impacting the audience in a positive way.

  Paak.

  All Adobe all day baby! I like to dabble in Processing every now and then to
  push myself out of my comfort zone and to force new ways of thinking.
