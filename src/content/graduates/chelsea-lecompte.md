intro: >-
  Chelsea grew up in the township of Wainfleet where the population there is
  about 6,000 people. She strives to implement the values that she has learned
  from her small town into her work, including ideas such as community,
  understanding and historical/cultural appreciation.


  She enjoys immersing herself in research order to create authentic experiences
  in her designs, such as learning about the environment, history and the
  communities surrounding a project. By doing so she creates experiences and
  products that are practical and best suited for the end user. By gaining a
  sense of empathetic understanding about the audiences she is designing for,
  she creates designs that help the audiences visualize and experience messages
  on a deep emotional level.

  and share stories beyond words. That design can help tell unique stories that
  evoke powerful emotional connections between people, places, organizations and
  communities.
