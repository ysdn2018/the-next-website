noun: STORY
intro: >-
  I grew up in the township of Wainfleet where the population there is about
  6,000 people. Being in the GTA and hearing sirens every two minutes is a far
  cry from the stretches of fields and mooing of cows I grew up around.


  However, growing up in such a small town made me attentive to people and the
  stories they have to tell. From listening to others talk about their thoughts
  and experiences, I’ve learned that every project has its own narrative, as
  well as people with voices who go along with it. It’s made me appreciate
  history and where things have come from, and so I immerse myself in research
  order to create authentic experiences in my designs. I’ve gained a sense of
  empathetic understanding from being involved in the aspects of community,
  which I try to bring forth when thinking about who I’m designing for.


  By implementing the small town ideals I was raised with into my work, I
  believe that design can be used as a powerful tool to help visualize and
  communicate stories that evoke powerful emotional connections.
hobbies: >-
  I'm a media junkie. I'm obsessed with movies and television for sure
  (especially reading biographies or behind the scenes stuff about them),
  knitting, reading random books from the library, blogging, thrift store
  shopping, playing indie board games and listening to podcasts.
music: >-
  Queen (I love all dad rock), Mariana's Trench, powerhouse lady singers like
  Beyoncé or Kesha, Top 100 Hits, Jimmy Buffett.
tools: 'InDesign, pens, x-acto knives, metal rulers, and my hands.'

  It's impossible to choose just one when there are so many fun ones out there.
  I love experimenting with different ones to capture the voice of what I'm
  creating for.
