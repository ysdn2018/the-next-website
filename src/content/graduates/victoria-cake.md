intro: >-
  Victoria is a curious creative with a passion for print communication and bold
  colours. Since high school, she knew that she wanted to be in a creative
  fieldâ€“she even set a goal to take every visual art class offered and nearly
  succeeded. These classes taught her the value of process and research, which
  is something she now appreciates. Due to her natural curiosity, Victoria can
  often get lost doing research and ideation. Victoria also loves to experiment
  with colour, which is why her use of colour is so strong. Tactile experiences
  are also important to Victoria because she enjoys working with her hands; this
  is why she loves print design.
