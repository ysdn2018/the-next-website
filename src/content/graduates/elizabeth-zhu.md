intro: >-
  Elizabeth is a human-centred designer who asks big picture questions. She
  believes problem-solving requires truly understanding a client and user's
  needs and contextualizing problems within its larger social framework. As a
  naturally holistic thinker, she is adept at identifying cause and effect
  relationships, drawing connections, and seeing opportunities for design to
  impact the world at-large. She hopes her career as a designer will help other
  peopleâ€™s lives in positive, meaningful ways. Elizabeth's empathetic and
  thoughtful personality makes her an excellent communicator, UX or
  client-facing designer, and team-player.
