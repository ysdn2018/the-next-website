intro: >-
  As a curious designer, Hannah always seeks to learn, experience, and venture
  into various subjects and mediums. She believes that reinterpreting and
  revisiting pre-existing definitions or elements are what enhances her design
  experience. As we are constantly exposed to the mundane, she believes that it
  is our duty as designers to redefine and emphasize these moments to cast new
  light upon them, to experience them like never before.
