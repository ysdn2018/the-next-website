  Before Clover moved to Canada in 2011, she was born and raised in Macau, which
  is a compact and vibrant city in China. Growing up in such a small city with
  diverse cultural backgrounds, she becomes easily adaptable to new environments
  and very appreciative of cultural differences. She is a multi-disciplinary
  designer whose passion lies in branding, communication, motion and package
  design. Through these different design streams, she always incorporates some
  interesting and meaningful stories in her work, which are mainly geared
  towards enhancing user experience, displaying cultural values and ultimately,
  leading to a positive impact in the world that can potentially change peoplesâ€™
  lives. She believes in the power of design that influences our everyday life,
  even without us realizing.
