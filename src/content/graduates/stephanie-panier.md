  Stephanie Panier takes pride in being an interdisciplinary designer. She likes
  to create fun, lighthearted designs that explore the idea of irony between
  text and image. She likes to use her design and art skills to create work that
  tests the boundaries between the two mediums to prove that they have the
  ability to coexist. She also really likes cats and carbs.
