intro: >-
  Bethany has always been curious to challenge traditional notions of design and
  pursues a more conceptual and hybrid approach to her creation process. Through
  design, Bethany always strives for “more” through a process of constant
  iteration and reiteration. She pushes the limits of form, meaning, and beauty
  often creating very unconventional pieces as a result.
