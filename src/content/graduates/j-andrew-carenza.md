  Andrew loves learning and discovery, putting them at the forefront of his
  principles as a designer. With a never-ending sense of curiosity, he found
  himself at home in design as integrates itself into just about every other
  field and discipline by nature. Andrew believes research and interdisciplinary
  understanding are what lie at the core of good design. He wholeheartedly
  embraces the process of investigation, breakdown and synthesis of information
  into strategy, creating work that is meaningful, effective and well designed.

  designing work from inside out, with the mission, messaging and visuals that
  unified can change behaviour, spark thought and always reach audiences on an
  emotional level.
