intro: >-
  Arman is a designer while his interests were at one point leaning more toward
  game development. To all honesty Arman did not enjoy design very much at the
  start of his studies but at one point he had a change of heart when he begun
  to create typefaces. Pairing the words “creating the next type” can be used to
  describe his thought process when creating a new typeface and designing in
  general. When designing his typeface, he starts by considering what its
  purpose will be and how it should be designed before he adds his own character
  to it.
