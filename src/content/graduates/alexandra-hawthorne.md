  Ally strives to make strategic and meaningful solutions. She believes design
  goes far beyond the physical product, it can be applied to both the tangible
  and intangible. Ally enjoys thinking outside the box, she celebrates
  experimentation and exploration at all stages of her design process. She has a
  passion for creating dynamic branding systems and marketing collateral. Ally

  not afraid to reinvent the wheel. “Asking simple questions about obvious
  things can lead to unexpected answers.” - Jon Freach
