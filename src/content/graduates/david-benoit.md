intro: >
  David is a Toronto based graphic designer from Montreal. Over the past couple
  of years, David saw his interest for the theorist of how art and society
  interact with each other. Using the theories of likes of Paul Rand, Rosalind
  E. Krauss and others who have shaped his design sense; David started to look
  at ways to communicate complicated concepts about our society. His intent is
  to foster a climate of productive discourse based on understanding the current
  framework our society operates under. Also, David believes art needs to play a
  bigger role in our day to day lives. To do so he started the process of
  designing concepts of what our livable space could become with the addition of
  art installation in our homes, offices and other shared livable environments.
