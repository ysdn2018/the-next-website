intro: >
  David is a Toronto based graphic designer from Montreal. Over the past couple
  of years, David started thinking more about how art and society interact.
  Using the theories of Paul Rand and Rosalind Krauss (among others), David
  started to develop his design sense and think about the different ways to
  communicate complicated concepts about our society. His intent is to foster a
  climate of productive discourse based on understanding the current framework
  our society operates under. Also, David believes art needs to play a bigger
  role in our day to day lives. To do so he started the process of designing
  concepts of what our livable space could become with the addition of art
  installation in our homes, offices and other shared livable environments.
