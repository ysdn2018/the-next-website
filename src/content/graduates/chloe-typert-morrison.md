intro: >-
  Chloe’s path to design started through a McDonald’s suggestion box. At 7 years
  old, she would run into a McDonald’s with her mom, stuff their suggestion box
  full of anti-animal cruelty slogans, and then run back to the car. Chloe soon
  realized that these actions wouldn’t solve anything without a proposed
  solution. Now, Chloe uses design as a way to solve problems for others;
  whether it be environmental sustainability, addressing the fear of crime in
  women, or assisting LGBTQ+ youth in learning more about themselves and their
  community. Her goal is to develop systems and products that will help protect
  the next generation from social and environmental issues that people face
  today.
