intro: >-
  Sandra believes in using design as a communication tool by exploring multiple
  approaches and perspectives. Her work addresses the importance of inclusivity
  through the contextualization of familiar and inviting themes of interests,
  and hopes to create thought-provoking experiences while opening opportunities
  for discourse. The right experience can show how design can cause us to
  question the way we think towards the next creative experience and she hopes
  to use her skillset as a way to provoke these types of experiences.
