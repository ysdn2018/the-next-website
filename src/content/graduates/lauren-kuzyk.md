intro: >-
  Lauren views her design persona as a strategist rather than an artist. She
  finds innovation through renovation by valuing existing systems while
  abandoning what is conventional. Her design process begins with divergent
  research and is centred around design thinking.


  What appeals most to Lauren about design is its ability to be so versatile and
  cross-disciplinary. She accepts design problems as invitations to explore
  diverse spheres, uniting differences with a shared quest to ameliorate. She is
  excited by the opportunity to immerse her analytical mind in a variety of
  environments and is optimistic about how design can better the world.
