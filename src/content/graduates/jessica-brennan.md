intro: >
  Jessica is a multidisciplinary designer with a strong focus in editorial,
  typography and illustration in both print and digital design.  To her, design
  is a means of visual expression that helps to express complex ideas with
  clarity while also getting to work with many unique people.


  Her lifelong interest in all things cute and pretty brought her to study
  illustration for 2 years. However, she quickly realized she didnâ€™t enjoy the
  actual process of drawing and painting. She stumbled across design, as a fall
  back and through her four years in the YSDN program fell in love with it. 


  With her background in illustration and a fine attention to detail she enjoys
  creating strong visual approaches that both serve a purpose and look
  beautiful.


  On the rare occasion she is not designing she enjoys watching the latest anime
  or playing games with her friends while having a slice of cake and a cup of
  tea.
