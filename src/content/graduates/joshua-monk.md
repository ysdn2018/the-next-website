  In Joshuaâ€™s perspective, design is an ongoing process of personal development.
  As a vocation, design requires a wide pre-existing repertoire of knowledge to
  identify and overcome obstacles, while remaining open and ready to take in new
  experiences and ideas. Joshua rounds out his design abilities with an
  insatiable curiosity, and aspires to produce work that shares this enthusiasm
  with others.
