intro: >-
  As a multidisciplinary designer, Saraâ€™s interests have always been tied to
  trying to make the world a better place through helping others. She believes
  the combination of using design thinking to try and solve or better combat
  social issues is very powerful. Designers have the potential to design spaces
  where social healing can take place. By understanding users, and how they
  respond to situations and products, designers are able to help solve minor
  issues that can make a big difference. Her goal is to not only be a part of
  the designers who strive to create a better world for future generations, but
  lead them in this change through the ideas and passions she plans to further
  develop and carry with her.
