intro: >-
  Martina Serafimovska believes that we all have a social responsibility to be
  mindful of what we put out into the world, and of the impact it has. On a
  personal level, she believes the field of Design is a perfect match for her,
  as it is a blend of her two lifelong interests: art & technology. She believes
  design is a tool for communication, development and meaningful purpose as much
  as it is an outlet for creativity and vision; in fact it is this duality that
  makes it uniquely beautiful. In her own work, she attempts to seek out the
  most effective solution, and then to showcase its elegance. Having always
  sought to leave a mark of positive difference in the world, she believes she
  can utilize design to do just that.

  up new skills in unfamiliar territories. On downtime, she likes to relax with
  a challenging video game or an interesting documentary.
