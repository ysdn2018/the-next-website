intro: >-
  A friend once told Sharon, “art is not necessarily about creativity, but about
  observation”. This quote is one that really relates to her and her take on
  art. Sharon believes that art is not always about how much ‘creativity’ is put
  into it – of course it could to others as art has no limitations – but is
  about the artist showing what he/she sees. Most people focus on the ‘creative’
  aspect of art but Sharon believes that if one focuses on creating art that
  represents their passions and views, then that should be enough to fuel their
  ‘creative juices’. The creative process shouldn't be forced, it should be
  natural and the most original thing that could come from art; something that
  comes from one’s passions and own perspective. 

  Sharon’s goal as a designer is to show people her feelings/perspectives
  through her work, and to affect their lives in a positive way.
