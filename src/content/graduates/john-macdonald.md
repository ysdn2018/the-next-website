  John began exploring art and design in high school but never pursued it
  seriously until a few years ago. After Returning to Sheridan College as a
  mature student, an instructor suggested applying to the Bachelor of Design
  program at York. Now nearing the end of his journey at YSDN he is excited to
  take on the next challenge. As a designer, John approaches every design
  problem as a learning opportunity. His design balances functionality with
  creating a memorable experience for the audience. Johnâ€™s strengths are in
