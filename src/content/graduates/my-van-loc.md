verb: Catching
noun: Plane
intro: >-
  My Van identifies as a thinker before a maker; as a creative aspiring to be a
  catalyst for other creatives, she interested in bridging the gaps between
  disciplines, as a former student of fine art and film. In any event, her work
  concerns telling cross cultural narratives. Soul-searching in Asia during her
  summers allowed Van to see how creativity can be approached on a global
  perspective to bridge the inherent gaps across communities, in ways unexplored
  in her Euro-centric education. Her work is inspired by how brands are treated
  globally, and woven into the fabric of life wherever they are taken. With a
  particular interest in chasing her own narrative through East Asian
  metropolises, in order to study current and future trends in the global
  creative market, she is currently focused in branding, strategy, and
  activation.
