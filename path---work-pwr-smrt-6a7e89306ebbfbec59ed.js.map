The average Canadian now pays double for energy than they did 10 years ago. In 2006 the average Canadian household paid $40.03 per month for electricity usage. In 2016 the average cost has risen to $83.18 per month. While it is often suggested that people use electric appliances on off-peak hours even these prices have risen quite significantly over the past 10 years. Off-peak pricing has gone from 3.5 to 8.7 cents per kilowatt hour, an increase of 150 percent. Mid-peak pricing went from 7.1 to 13.2 cents per kilowatt hour, and increase of 85%, and on-peak pricing has gone from 10.5 to 18.0 cents per kilowatt hour, and increase of 70%. Now more than ever Canadians are interested in seeing where their energy is being used, and where their money is going. This products aims to help with this by allowing users to instantly see their usage as soon as a device it turned on.</p>\\n<h2>Process</h2>\\n<p>This project started with extensive research. Understanding what the problem is, who it affects and in what ways it affects them allows for the design to be better suited for the audience it meets. For this project in particular raw data was observed from Statistics Canada and Toronto Hydro. From here benchmarking began on existing applications that worked in a similar manner to the application being designed. From benchmarking it became clear that existing applications, while they apparently did what was intended, were not user friendly and their interfaces lacked easy navigation. After benchmarking, different forms of data visualization were compiled to have a starting point for how the data could be represented.</p>\\n<h2>Solution</h2>\\n<p>This product is a monitoring device of energy usage in your home. The smart device attaches to the home’s circuit board and tracks all instances of electricity being used as well as “phantom energy” to help the users locate where they use energy and how they can lower their hydro bills. The companion application tracks the overall energy use of the house, the use of each major appliance, location in the house that uses the most energy and the cost. The application achieves its goals by providing a unique visualization that allows users to see where most of their energy consumption is coming from without overwhelming them with too many numbers. </p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.64999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Main dashboard of PWR SMRT app.\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/pwrsmrt_p1-5c2c5e9afdfcefae7f0df5548005b311-755ae.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/pwrsmrt_p1-5c2c5e9afdfcefae7f0df5548005b311-f07fc.jpg 125w,\\n/static/pwrsmrt_p1-5c2c5e9afdfcefae7f0df5548005b311-9d06f.jpg 250w,\\n/static/pwrsmrt_p1-5c2c5e9afdfcefae7f0df5548005b311-755ae.jpg 500w,\\n/static/pwrsmrt_p1-5c2c5e9afdfcefae7f0df5548005b311-63ca3.jpg 750w,\\n/static/pwrsmrt_p1-5c2c5e9afdfcefae7f0df5548005b311-9b9a3.jpg 1000w,\\n/static/pwrsmrt_p1-5c2c5e9afdfcefae7f0df5548005b311-6e031.jpg 1500w,\\n/static/pwrsmrt_p1-5c2c5e9afdfcefae7f0df5548005b311-2a439.jpg 2000w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p>The graph works by creating a plot point as soon as an appliance is turned on and then stops when the appliance turns off.
