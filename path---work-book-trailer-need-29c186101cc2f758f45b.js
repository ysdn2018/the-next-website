She has an obsession with phobias and is constantly naming them. She has been acting weird since her stepfather died and is sent to Maine to live with her grandmother to get her to open up. Sadly, the semi-stalker is not a figment of Zara’s overactive imagination. He follows her and leaves an eerie trail of gold dust everywhere he places his foot. There is something not human in the small town of Maine and all heads are turned toward Zara. The book delivers romance, suspense, and a creature you’d never thought you’d fear.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Book Trailer - Need",graduate:"Stephanie Walser",category:"Time Based Communication",category2:null,category3:null,image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQCAwUG/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABp1ueYCTJiP8A/8QAHBAAAQMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgABIgMEERIh/9oACAEBAAEFArZ5bxLpBlVXIGX/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/AT//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAbEAACAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARECECExUf/aAAgBAQAGPwIkb6bFTOLf/8QAGRABAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAIVEx/9oACAEBAAE/IXCM4fdAm8DX7q4AEls3YOPMFN//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEGvf/8QAFhEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAx/9oACAEDAQE/EIF//8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAR/9oACAECAQE/EE1n/8QAGxABAAMBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBUZH/2gAIAQEAAT8QAgWHfE5EDC/Y3hFqtfpjdg0rozQz5xl8h6ePU//Z",aspectRatio:1.5,src:"/the-next-website/static/screen-shot-2018-03-30-at-3.21.51-pm-21843b85462d44c4899fb4734dd28499-a7a62.jpg",srcSet:"/the-next-website/static/screen-shot-2018-03-30-at-3.21.51-pm-21843b85462d44c4899fb4734dd28499-5a1a9.jpg 375w,\n/the-next-website/static/screen-shot-2018-03-30-at-3.21.51-pm-21843b85462d44c4899fb4734dd28499-0908c.jpg 750w,\n/the-next-website/static/screen-shot-2018-03-30-at-3.21.51-pm-21843b85462d44c4899fb4734dd28499-a7a62.jpg 1500w,\n/the-next-website/static/screen-shot-2018-03-30-at-3.21.51-pm-21843b85462d44c4899fb4734dd28499-83d7d.jpg 2000w",sizes:"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"}}}}},projectsInCategory:{edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{title:"(Anti)socialized",graduate:"Danielle Sheahan"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Book Trailer for Sputnik Sweetheart - A Novel by Haruki Murakami",graduate:"David Benoit"}}}]},projectByStudent:{edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Book Trailer - Need",graduate:"Stephanie Walser"}}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"/work/book-trailer-need/",name:"/Book Trailer - Need/",title:"Book Trailer - Need",graduate:"/Stephanie Walser/",category:"/Time Based Communication/"}}}});
