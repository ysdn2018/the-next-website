Having previously fought off two alien invasions, Earth is preparing for an impending third invasion by enlisting and training young and brilliant children with the potential to save their planet. The novel follows Ender Wiggin (a boy who shows great promise) as he journies through the trials and psychological challenges of rising through the ranks of the military. With the human race said to be running out of time, Ender’s tactical genius is pushed to its limits as he just may be Earth’s last hope.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Capturing The Essence Of The Book</h2>\n<p>Though it had its theatrical release in 2013, the novel Ender’s Game remains a renowned story for its compelling narrative and depth of interpretation. Although the film might capture the visual spectacle of ships and explosions, the challenge in adapting Ender’s Game as a visual medium is about delving into what the novel is truly about: the internal struggle and psychological challenges Ender faces, being Earth’s last hope.</p>\n<h2>Planning</h2>\n<p>After beginning with a session of rapid brainstorming and sketching out ideas, I realized the real value in adapting the book would be diving back into its story myself and picking out its essential elements.</p>\n<p>Instead of simply reciting the events through an expository voiceover as the movie trailer did, I sought to find key moments and insightful dialog which encapsulated the tone of the story. I began reading through the story again. I highlighted dialog and noted key moments until I found the perfect quote of Colonel Graff inviting Ender to attend his battle school (a pivotal moment in the book).</p>\n<h2>Visualizing Ender’s Game</h2>\n<p>Ender Wiggin was bred to be a solider and once accepted into the academy, he spends every waking moment training in battle simulations. These training exercises and psychological worlds consume his life and everyone around him. As such, the trailer utilizes retro vectorized and distorted computer graphics, to create a cohesive visual aesthetic for the entire sequence.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Ender’s Game — Book Trailer",graduate:"Sean Lautenschlager",category:"Time Based Communication",category2:"Motion Design",category3:"",image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.5,src:"/static/sean_lauten-enders_game-1-0e2b94d3cbfc1e503900cb6d86e48ef1-0f681.png",srcSet:"/static/sean_lauten-enders_game-1-0e2b94d3cbfc1e503900cb6d86e48ef1-c1674.png 375w,\n/static/sean_lauten-enders_game-1-0e2b94d3cbfc1e503900cb6d86e48ef1-34f47.png 750w,\n/static/sean_lauten-enders_game-1-0e2b94d3cbfc1e503900cb6d86e48ef1-0f681.png 1500w,\n/static/sean_lauten-enders_game-1-0e2b94d3cbfc1e503900cb6d86e48ef1-8123c.png 2000w",sizes:"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"}}}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/work/ender’s-game/",name:"/Ender’s Game — Book Trailer/"}}}});
